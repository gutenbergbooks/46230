<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this volume I have endeavored to give
my young readers a clearer and a more intimate
knowledge than is usually possessed of the vast
territory known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
which is a collection of provinces united
under one ruler, and which is, strange to say,
the only country of importance in the world that
has not a distinctive language of its own, since
the various races&mdash;German, Slav, Magyar and
others&mdash;each speak their own tongue.</p>

<p>The northeastern provinces, Galicia and
Bukowina, have not been considered in this
book, owing to the fact that they are included in
<span class="smcap">Our Little Polish Cousin</span>; and, for a similar
reason, Hungary and Bohemia have been
omitted, as each is the subject of an earlier
volume in <span class="smcap">The Little Cousin Series</span>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
book consequently is chiefly devoted to Austria
proper and Tyrol, but the other provinces, including
Dalmatia and Bosnia, are not neglected.</p>

<p>The publication of <span class="smcap"><b>Our Little Austrian
Cousin</b></span> is most timely, since the Balkan War,
now drawing to a close, has occupied the attention
of the world. The Balkan States lie
just to the south of the Austrian Empire, and
Austria has taken a leading part in defining
the terms of peace which the Great Powers of
Europe insist shall be granted by the Balkan
allies to the defeated Turks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><b>Our Little Austrian Cousin</b></span> can well be
read in connection with <span class="smcap">Our Little Bulgarian
Cousin</span> and <span class="smcap">Our Little Servian
Cousin</span>, describing two of the principal Balkan
States, which volumes have just been added to
<span class="smcap">The Little Cousin Series</span>.</p>

<p>Among others, I am especially indebted to
Fr. H. E. Palmer, for much information concerning
country customs in Upper Austria.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>A VISIT TO OLD VIENNA</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hurrah!</span>" shouted Ferdinand, as he burst
into the living-room, just as his mother was
having afternoon coffee.</p>

<p>"And what makes my son so joyful?" asked
Frau Müller, as she looked up at the rosy
cheeks of her young son.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, mother! Don't you know? This
is the end of school."</p>

<p>"So it is," replied the mother. "But I had
other things in my head."</p>

<p>"And, do you know," the child continued, as
he drew up to the table where the hot coffee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
emitted refreshing odors, "you haven't told
me yet where we are to go."</p>

<p>"No, Ferdinand, we've wanted to surprise
you. But help yourself to the cakes," and the
mother placed a heaping dish of fancy kuchen
before the lad.</p>

<p>Ferdinand did not require a second invitation;
like all normal boys, he was always hungry;
but I doubt very much if he knew what
real American-boy-hunger was, because the
Austrian eats more frequently than we, having
at least five meals a day, three of which are composed
of coffee and delicious cakes, so that one
seldom has time to become ravenous.</p>

<p>"But, mother," persisted the child, his
mouth half filled with kuchen, "I <i>wish</i> I knew.
Tell me when we start; will you tell me that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered his mother, smiling. "To-day
is Wednesday; Saturday morning we shall
leave."</p>

<p>"Oh, I just can't wait! I <i>wish</i> I knew."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps father will tell you when he
comes," suggested the mother. "Do you think
you could possibly wait that long?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can," answered the lad,
frankly; "but I suppose I shall have to."</p>

<p>That evening, when Herr Müller returned
from his shop, Ferdinand plied him with questions
in an effort to win from him, if possible,
the long-withheld secret.</p>

<p>"Well, son, there's no use trying to keep you
in the dark any longer. Where do you guess
we are going?"</p>

<p>"To see Cousin Leopold in Tyrol."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a very good guess, and not all
wrong, either; but guess again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't. It must be splendid, if it's
better than visiting Cousin Leopold."</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>is</i> better," continued Herr Müller;
"for not only are we going to pass a few days
with your Tyrolese relations, but we are going
to a farm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy's face fell visibly.</p>

<p>"To a farm!" he exclaimed. "Why, Uncle
Hofer has a splendid farm in Tyrol; that won't
be very new to me, then."</p>

<p>"It won't!" ejaculated his father, a trifle
amused. "You wait and see, my boy. This is
not to be a tiny farm of a few acres, creeping
up the mountain on one side and jumping off
into a ravine on the other. We sha'n't have to
tie <i>this</i> farm to boulders to keep it from slipping
away from us." And Herr Müller
chuckled.</p>

<p>"Then it isn't in the mountains?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't in the mountains; that is, not
in any mountains that are like the Tyrolese
mountains. But there will be acres and acres
of this farm, and you will be miles away
from any one. You will see corn growing,
too; you've never seen that in Tyrol, my
son."</p>

<p>"No," answered the child. After a few moments'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
silence, he added: "Will there be any
young folks, father?"</p>

<p>"Don't let that trouble you, Ferdinand;
where there's an Austrian farm there are many
children."</p>

<p>"Hurrah for the farm, then!" shouted Ferdinand,
much to the astonishment and amusement
of his parents, who were unused to such
impulsive outbursts. But Ferdinand Müller
was a typical boy, even though he had been
reared in the heart of the city of Vienna,
where the apartment houses stand shoulder to
shoulder, and back to back, with no room for
play-yards or gardens, even; the outside windows
serving the latter duty, while the school
building on week-days, and the public parks on
holidays, serve the former. Austrian children
are never allowed to play on the street; but,
as if to make up to their children for the loss
of play-space, the Austrian parents take them,
upon every available occasion, to the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
parks where are provided all sorts of amusements
and refreshments at a modest sum.</p>

<p>"Father," asked the lad, after a few moments'
silence, during which he had sat thinking
quietly, "when shall we start?"</p>

<p>"Saturday morning, my son. I believe your
mother has everything in readiness, <i>nicht war,
meine liebe Frau?</i>" he asked, as he glanced
over his paper at his wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, <i>do</i> say you are ready," pleaded
the child, who, for all his twelve years, and his
finely developed body, was yet a boy, and impulsive.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm all ready," she replied.</p>

<p>And, for the rest of the evening, silence descended
upon the boy, his small brain being
filled with visions of the coming pleasure.</p>

<p>When Herr Müller returned to his home the
following evening, he found a letter, postmarked
"Linz," awaiting him.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said, half aloud, "here's word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
from our friend Herr Runkel. Wonder if
there's anything happened to upset our plans?"</p>

<p>"Oh, father, please don't say it," pleaded
the boy; "I shall be so disappointed."</p>

<p>"Well, cheer up," replied his father,
"there's better news than you thought for.
We shall leave on Saturday morning as
planned; but to-morrow Herr Runkel's sister
from the convent will come to us. He asks us
to take charge of her, as the Sisters find it very
inconvenient this year to send an escort with
her; and, as we are coming up in a day or two,
perhaps we would not mind the extra trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, father, won't it be fine! How old is
she?"</p>

<p>"I believe about your age."</p>

<p>Friday morning Frau Müller and Ferdinand
jumped into a fiaker and drove to the railroad
station to meet Teresa Runkel. She was a fine-looking
child, with round, rosy cheeks; quite
tall, with the fair complexion, sunny hair, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
soft, Austrian blue eyes that makes the women
of that land famed for their beauty. She was
overjoyed at this unexpected pleasure of spending
a day or two in the city of Vienna, which
she had never seen, although she had passed
through several times on her way to and from
the convent. She enjoyed the brisk drive to the
tall apartment house in the Schwanengasse, and
she fairly bubbled with chatter.</p>

<p>"After luncheon, my dear," observed Frau
Müller, "we shall have Herr Müller take you
about our city; for Vienna is vastly different
from Linz."</p>

<p>Herr Müller joined the party at luncheon at
eleven o'clock, which was really the breakfast
hour, because Austrian families take only coffee
and cakes or rolls in the early morning, eating
their hearty breakfast toward the middle of the
day, after which they rest for an hour or two,
before beginning their afternoon duties.</p>

<p>At two o'clock the three were ready for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
walk, for Frau Müller was not to accompany
them. Joseph, the portier, an important personage
in Viennese life, nodded "A-b-e-n-d"
to them, as they passed out the front door of
the building, over which he presided as a sort
of turnkey. No one may pass in or out without
encountering the wary eye of Joseph, who must
answer to the police for the inmates of the
building, as also for the visitors. And this is a
curious custom, not only in Vienna, but other
European cities, that immediately upon one's
arrival at an hotel, or even a private home, the
police are notified, unawares to the visitor, of
his movements and his object in being in the
city, which reduces chances of crime to a minimum;
burglary being almost unknown, picking
pockets on the open streets taking its place in
most part.</p>

<p>"Of course you know, children," said Herr
Müller, as they passed along the broad Kärtnerstrasse,
where are the finest shops of Vienna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
"you've been taught in school the history of
our city, so I need not tell you that."</p>

<p>"Oh, but please do, father," said Ferdinand.
"Teresa may not know it as well as I do,"&mdash;he
hesitated, for he noticed the hurt look in the
girl's eyes, and added&mdash;"although she may
know a lot more about other things."</p>

<p>"Well," began the father, "away back in
the times before Christ, a body of rough men
came from the northern part of France and the
surrounding countries. They were called Celts.
They were constantly roving; and so it chanced
they came to this very spot where we now are,
and founded a village which they called Vindobona.
But about fourteen years after Christ,
the Romans worked their way northward; they
saw the village of the Celts and captured it.
They built a great wall about it, placed a moat
outside of these fortifications and settled down
to retain their conquest. They built a forum,
which was a public square where all the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the city was transacted; and, on one side,
they placed their camp or praetorium. To-day,
we call the Roman forum the Hohermarkt, just
here where we stand now," continued Herr
Müller, "and here, where the Greek banker
Sina has built this fine palace, stood the Roman
praetorium; while here, you see the street is
named for Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor
who was born in Spain and died in this
city so many hundreds of years ago."</p>

<p>"I've heard that ever so many times, father,"
said Ferdinand, "but I never realized it before;
somehow it seems as if I could almost see the
Celts driven out and the great wall and moat
of the Romans."</p>

<p>Meanwhile they had walked on, down the
Bauermarkt and reached the St. Stephanienplatz,
with St. Stephan's Church in the middle.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;">

<div class="caption">ST. STEPHAN'S CHURCH.</div>
</div>

<p>"There," said Herr Müller, pointing to the
beautiful edifice, "is the oldest monument we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
have in Vienna, begun in 1144. Duke Heinrich
Jasomirgott founded it."</p>

<p>"Oh, he was our first duke," spoke up
Teresa, who also wished to prove that she
knew <i>her</i> Austrian history as well as her
friend.</p>

<p>"Yes, Teresa," answered Herr Müller.
"But it's a long jump from the Romans to
Duke Heinrich. Several hundred years after
the expulsion of the Celts from Vindobona,
Charlemagne, the undaunted conqueror of the
age, absorbed it into the German Empire; he
distinguished it from the rest of the German
Empire by giving it the name of the Eastmark
or border of the empire (Oesterreich), hence
Austria. He placed a lord or margrave over
it; and when Conrad III of Germany became
emperor, he appointed Heinrich Jasomirgott
ruler over the Eastmark, giving him, at the
same time, the adjoining territory of Bavaria.
But he had no right to dispose of these Bavarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
lands as he chose, just because he was angry
with the Bavarians; and when his son, Frederick
Redbeard (Barbarossa) came to the
throne, he gave it back to the Bavarians. But
Frederick Redbeard was a politic ruler; he did
not wish to offend any of his subjects; in order
to make up to Henry Jasomirgott for the loss of
Bavaria, he raised him to the rank of duke,
and thus Oesterreich or the Eastmark became
a duchy. This was about 1100; then, being
such an important personage, Duke Heinrich
determined to make his home in Vienna. He
built himself a strong castle, surrounded it with
a high stone wall and a moat, as was the custom
at that time, and included within it the confines
of the city, so that he and his people might
not be molested by neighboring princes.</p>

<p>"Here," continued Herr Müller, as they
passed to the end of the Platz, "is the Graben.
To-day it is our most fashionable shopping district;
but in the time of Duke Heinrich it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a moat filled with water; and here, where these
rows of modern houses stand, were the ancient
walls which protected the city."</p>

<p>"Isn't it great!" cried Teresa, who, girl
though she was, could appreciate the ancient
struggles of her ancestors for liberty and defence.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, there is Der Stock im Eisen!"
said Ferdinand. "Tell Teresa about that,
please; she doesn't know."</p>

<p>"Der Stock im Eisen?" repeated Teresa.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That old tree with the iron hoop around it,
at the corner of the Graben," replied her companion.</p>

<p>"We will reserve that tale for the evening,"
answered Herr Müller; "it is getting toward
coffee hour, and we want to visit many places
yet."</p>

<p>As he spoke, they walked slowly along the
Graben, which means Moat in German, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
at the end of several minutes, they reached a
large open square called Platz am Hof.</p>

<p>"Here is what remains of the palace of the
House of Babenberg, which Duke Heinrich
built," said Herr Müller; "and here before it
you see the Tiefe-graben, or deep moat, which
amply protected the stronghold from attack.
And there," he continued, moving as he spoke
toward the building, "stands the Schottenhof."</p>

<p>"The Schottenhof?" exclaimed Teresa, astonished.
"Why is it called a Scottish palace
in Austria?"</p>

<p>"Because it was originally built and occupied
by some monks from Scotland in the year 1158,
whom Duke Heinrich had asked to come and
instruct the citizens, not only in religion, but in
the educational arts, there being no schools in
those days; all the teaching was done by the
Holy Fathers. But later on, the Scottish monks
were dispossessed by a German order of monks;
yet the Hof still bears the name of its founders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
And even to-day the Church owns all this most
valuable property, right in the very heart of our
city, which was given to them so many years
ago."</p>

<p>"That's the first time I thought about the
Hof being Scottish," admitted Ferdinand, between
whom and Teresa there was much rivalry
and jealousy as to the amount of knowledge possessed
by each; but the lad was generous
enough to admit his ignorance, because he did
not wish to assume too superior airs before his
guest.</p>

<p>"Here runs the tiny lane, the Schotten-gasse,
which separates the Schottenhof from the
smaller Molkerhof just across the land; and
here are the ancient bastions which protected
them; to-day, you notice, these same names are
retained; the bastions are no longer required,
but history preserves their memory in preserving
their names, the Schotten-bastei and the
Molker-bastei, now streets of the city of Vienna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
instead of bastions. But we have had quite
enough of history," continued Herr Müller,
"I am quite certain our little convent friend is
tired."</p>

<p>"Oh, no indeed," spoke up Teresa. "At the
convent we take long walks every day; and in
the country at Linz, we do much walking, too;
it does not tire me at all."</p>

<p>"But walking about city streets is quite different
from country lanes, my girl," observed
Herr Müller.</p>

<p>"Yes, but we do not have the interesting
places to visit, nor the tales to hear, in the
lanes," wisely answered the child.</p>

<p>"Well, then, if you are quite certain you are
not too tired, we will walk home. We will go
by the way of the Ring, here behind the Schottenhof;
and we will walk over the old walls,
which were erected in later years as the original
city of Duke Heinrich grew. Of course, we
have no use for these fortifications in these days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
so we have changed them into a magnificent
boulevard."</p>

<p>No one, not knowing the original use of the
Ring, would ever have suspected the mission it
had fulfilled; so broad and handsome was the
avenue encircling what is called the Inner-Stadt
(Inner City), planted with magnificent trees,
and bubbling over with life, color and gayety.</p>

<p>Teresa would like to have stopped at every
fine building and park, but Herr Müller promised
to ask her brother to allow her a few days
with them in Vienna before returning to the
convent in the fall, that she might see all there
was not time now to show her. For the present
must suffice a cursory glance at the Burghof or
imperial residence, the royal theatre, the Hofgarten
and the Volksgarten, gay with the
scarlet skirts and gold cloth caps of hundreds
of nurse-maids watching over their youthful
cares.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be splendid to be an emperor,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
remarked Teresa to her companion, "and live
in such a fine palace?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that isn't much of a palace," remarked
Ferdinand, somewhat contemptuously, "that's
just like a prison to me; you ought to see Schönbrunn,
the summer home of the Emperor."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been to Schönbrunn," returned the
girl with disdain in her voice. "The Sisters
took us all there once; they showed us the room
where the Duke of Reichstadt died, and where
his father, Napoleon, lived when he took
Vienna."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll bet you haven't seen the celebration
on Maundy Thursday, when the Emperor
sends his twenty-four gorgeous gala coaches
with their magnificent horses and mounted escorts
in uniform to bring the four and twenty
poor men and women to his palace, that he
might humble himself to wash their feet?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't seen that," admitted Teresa.
"Tell me about it. Have <i>you</i> seen it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've heard father tell about it a number of
times," continued the lad. "The Emperor
sends his wonderful holiday coaches with the
escorts in gorgeous uniforms; they bring the
poor men and women to the palace and set a
splendid banquet before them; then they go to
the royal chapel and hear Mass, at which the
Emperor and the royal family, and the entire
Court are present; after that, the poor folks
are led to the banquet hall and here they are
served from silver platters which the Emperor
and his royal family present to them. After
that, the Emperor kneels before them and wipes
their feet with a wet cloth."</p>

<p>"He does that himself?" asked Teresa,
who had listened spellbound, that her beloved
emperor should conduct such a ceremony.</p>

<p>"Indeed he does! And, furthermore,"
added the boy, with ineffable pride, "he is the
only monarch, so father tells me, who preserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the ancient custom. But that isn't all; the
Emperor sends these astonished poor people
home again in the gorgeous coaches; he gives
them each a purse in which is about fifteen dollars;
he sends a great basket filled with the
remains of the banquet which they have left untouched,
together with a bottle of wine and a
fine bouquet of flowers;&mdash;and, what do you
think, Teresa?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I couldn't guess," admitted the
child.</p>

<p>"He gives them the silver platters from
which he served them."</p>

<p>"What a splendid emperor!" cried Teresa.
Then she added, "I've seen the Emperor."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing," most ungallantly replied
the boy. "Franz-Joseph walks about our
streets like Haroun-al-Raschid used to in the
Arabian Nights. <i>Any</i> one can see the Emperor;
he allows even the poorest to come and see him
in his palace every week; and he talks to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
just as if he was a plain, ordinary man and not
an emperor at all."</p>

<div class="caption">EMPEROR FRANZ-JOSEPH.</div>
</div>

<p>"Well, I've had him speak to me," answered
Teresa. "At the convent he praised my work."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. Herr Müller
walked along, not a muscle in his face betraying
the fact that he had overheard this juvenile conversation,
for fear of interrupting a most entertaining
dialogue.</p>

<p>"Has he ever spoken <i>directly</i> to you?" demanded
the girl, seeing that Ferdinand did not
reply.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Again a dead silence.</p>

<p>"The Emperor needs our love and sympathy,"
said Herr Müller, after waiting in vain
for the children to renew their talk; "his beloved
empress Elizabeth has been taken from
him by an assassin's hand; his favorite brother
Maximilian went to his doom in the City of
Mexico, the victim of the ambition of a Napoleon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
even his heir, the crown-prince is dead;
and when our beloved king shall be no more,
the very name of Habsburg will have passed
away."</p>

<p>"He is a very kind man," replied Teresa.
"He comes often to the convent; and he makes
us feel that he is not an emperor but one of us."</p>

<p>Herr Müller touched his hat in respect.
"Long live our beloved emperor, our most
sympathetic friend," he said.</p>

<p>By this time they had gained the entrance of
their home; Joseph opened the public door to
admit them to the corridor, and they ascended
to the third floor to the apartment of Herr
Müller.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>DER STOCK IM EISEN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> evening, after a hearty dinner, the
children called for the story of Der Stock im
Eisen. And so Herr Müller began:</p>

<p>"Many hundreds of years ago, in the old
square known as the Horsemarket, lived
Vienna's most skilful master-locksmith, Herr
Erhanrd Marbacher. Next door to him, stood
a baker-shop owned by the Widow Mux. The
widow and Herr Marbacher were good neighbors,
and were fond of chatting together outside
the doors of their homes, as the evening
came on; Herr Marbacher smoking his long,
quaintly-painted pipe, and the Widow Mux relating
the sprightly anecdotes of the day.</p>

<p>"But, one evening, Herr Marbacher found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the widow in great distress; as she usually wore
a merry smile upon her jolly face this change in
temperament greatly affected the spirits of the
locksmith, and he demanded the cause of her
unhappiness. With tears in her eyes, the widow
confided to her neighbor the dreadful fact that
her younger son, Martin, a worthless, idle fellow,
had refused to do any work about the shop,
and had even used harsh words.</p>

<p>"'Sometimes it happens,' suggested the
master-locksmith, 'that a lad does not take to
his forced employment; it may be that Martin
is not cut out for a baker; let me have a hand
with him; perhaps he will make a first-rate
locksmith.'</p>

<p>"'A locksmith!' exclaimed the widow in
astonishment. 'How can he become a locksmith,
with its attendant hard work, when he
will not even run errands for the baker-shop!
No, Herr Marbacher, you are very kind to suggest
it, and try to help me out of my trouble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
but Martin would never consent to become a
locksmith's apprentice. He is downright lazy.'</p>

<p>"'Well, you might let me have a trial with
him,' said the locksmith; 'I am loved by all my
workmen, yet they fear me, too; they do good
work under my direction, and I am proud of
my apprentices. Martin, I am certain, would
also obey me.'</p>

<p>"'Well, have your way, good neighbor,' replied
the widow, 'I can only hope for the best.'</p>

<p>"Evidently Herr Marbacher knew human
nature better than the widow, for Martin was
delighted with the prospect of becoming an
apprentice-locksmith, with the hope of earning
the degree of master-locksmith, like Herr Marbacher,
and he worked hard and long to please
his master. His mother was overjoyed at the
change in the lad, and Herr Marbacher himself
was very well pleased.</p>

<p>"Now, it chanced that some little time after
Martin's apprenticeship, Herr Marbacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
handed him a tin pail and directed him to a
certain spot on the edge of the forest, without
the city walls, where he should gather clay with
which to mould a certain form, for which he
had had an order. As the commission was a
particular one, and somewhat out of the ordinary,
it required a peculiar sort of clay which
was only to be found in this particular spot.</p>

<p>"With light heart, and whistling a merry
tune, Martin, swinging his tin pail, set out upon
his errand. The day was perfect; Spring was
just beginning; the trees were clothed in their
fresh greenness, light clouds flitted across a
marvelously blue sky, the birds twittered noisily
in the treetops and Martin caught the Spring
fever; he fairly bounded over the green fields,
and reached the forest in a wonderfully short
time.</p>

<p>"Having filled his pail, he started homewards.
But, instead of keeping to the path by
which he had come, he crossed through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
meadows, his heart as light as ever. Suddenly
he espied through the trees figures of men or
boys; then voices came to his ears; he stopped
and listened. Boy-like, he was unable to resist
the temptation&mdash;the lure of the Spring&mdash;so
he changed his course and made toward the
bowlers, his old-time cronies, who were engaged
in their old-time sport. Slower moved his feet,&mdash;his
conscience prompted him in vain&mdash;he
forgot the admonition of his master not to loiter
on the way, for fear the city gates would be shut
at the ringing of the curfew; he forgot all
about the time of day, and that it was now well
on toward evening. The fever of the Spring
had gotten into his veins; Martin paused, set
down his bucket of clay, and, picking up a bowl,
joined in the sport of his comrades.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/i045.jpg" width="367" height="500" alt="boy standing in frontof man" />
<div class="caption">"'CHEER UP, MY LAD,' SAID THE STRANGER."</div>
</div>

<p>"Suddenly the curfew bell reached his ears;
he recalled his errand, the warning of his master,
and his heart stopped still in fright. He
dropped the bowl in his hands, grasped his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
bucket of clay, and ran with beating heart
toward the city gate, but he was too late; the
gate was closed and the gate-keeper either
would not or could not hear his call.</p>

<p>"Fear now seized Martin, in very truth.
The woods about the city were infested with
robbers and dangerous men; there was no way
in which to protect himself; yet he had nothing
about him which any one would care to have,
and that thought gave him some comfort. As
he was planning how he might get within the
walls, a tall man dressed in scarlet feathered
cap and a long black velvet cloak upon his
shoulders, stood before him.</p>

<p>"'Cheer up, my lad,' said the stranger.
'What is the use of crying?'</p>

<p>"'But I am locked out for the night,' replied
Martin.</p>

<p>"'That is nothing to fret about,' answered
the tall man. 'Here is some gold. Take it, it
will open the gate for you.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Oh, thank you,' said Martin, overjoyed.
Then he hesitated. 'But I shall never be able
to repay you,' he added. 'I have never seen so
much gold.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, do not fret yourself about repaying
me,' answered the stranger. 'I have plenty of
gold, and do not need the little I have given
you. Still, if you are really anxious to repay
me, you might give me your soul when you have
finished with it.'</p>

<p>"'My soul?' cried the boy aghast. 'I
can't give it to you. One cannot sell his
soul?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes,' replied the malicious stranger,
smiling grimly, 'many people do sell their
souls; but you need not give it me until you are
dead.'</p>

<p>"'Much good would it do you then,' replied
Martin; 'I cannot see what you would want
with it after I am dead?'</p>

<p>"'That is the bargain,' retorted the tall man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
And he made as if to move away and leave
Martin to his fate.</p>

<p>"'Oh, very well,' said Martin, fearing to
throw away this chance for deliverance. 'I
will take your gold, and you may have my soul
when I have finished with it; the bargain is
made.'</p>

<p>"'And I shall be lenient with you,' continued
the stranger. 'I will give you a chance to redeem
your soul.'</p>

<p>"'You will?' exclaimed Martin in delight.
'And how?'</p>

<p>"'Only this, if you forget to attend divine
service even once, during all the rest of your
days, then shall I claim my bargain. Now, am
I not fair?'</p>

<p>"Martin was very glad to be released, even
with this proviso, and laughed as he moved
away, for Martin had been brought up religiously
by a pious mother, and he knew he should
not forget his Sabbath duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"As the stranger had said, the gold gained
entrance for Martin Mux through the closed
city gate, and he straightway made his way to
his room and to bed before his master should
discover his absence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Some days later, as the apprentices were
hard at work in the shop under the scrutinizing
eye of Herr Marbacher, a tall man in a black
velvet cloak and a red plumed cap, stood in the
doorway. Martin recognized his erstwhile
friend and feared he knew not what. But the
stranger had come to order an iron hoop with
padlock so intricate that it could not be unlocked.</p>

<p>"Herr Marbacher hesitated; the order was
certainly unusual, and even he, the master-locksmith
of Vienna, was uncertain whether he could
accomplish such a commission. But, seeing
Marbacher's hesitation, the stranger cast his
glance about the shop full of young apprentices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and fixing his regard upon Martin, he said, in
a loud voice:</p>

<p>"'Among all these workmen, is there not one
who can make the lock?'</p>

<p>"Whether impelled by fear, or feeling that
having assisted him once, the devil would assist
him yet a second time, Martin spoke out,</p>

<p>"'I will do it.'</p>

<p>"All eyes turned toward the young apprentice.</p>

<p>"'You?' cried Marbacher, and he laughed
very loud and very long, so excellent did he
consider the joke. 'You? You are my very
youngest apprentice.'</p>

<p>"'Let him try,' suggested the stranger
warily, fearing the master would deny Martin
the privilege. 'Who knows what he may be
able to accomplish?'</p>

<p>"And so it was agreed.</p>

<p>"Martin worked all that day until the evening
shadows compelled him to quit his work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
He racked his brain; he thought and thought;
yet no lock could he imagine which could not
be unlocked. He carried his paper and pencil
to his room with him, thinking that in the stillness
of the night he might think of some design.
But, although he worked conscientiously, no
ideas came to him, and he fell asleep. With
visions of locks and bolts and bars in his head,
it was no wonder that Martin dreamed of robbers'
castles and dungeons and locks and bolts.
He dreamed about a mighty robber in a fortress-castle;
he was a prisoner there, he, Martin;
but what his crime he did not know. He
rushed toward the door to make his escape; it
was locked; he tried to undo it, but in vain;
then he looked about him, and the room seemed
filled with padlocks, some small, some large,
some handsomely wrought, some very simple;
but among them he found one that looked like
a huge spider. It interested him so much that
he took out his pencil and mechanically reproduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
it; then he felt himself sinking, sinking,
down, down. With a start he awoke, he had
tossed himself out of bed and lay sprawling
upon the floor of his room. Rather piqued,
Martin picked himself up and jumped into bed.
But there upon his pillow lay a drawing. He
examined it by the feeble rays of the candle,
which was still burning; it was the design of
the spider lock he had seen in the robber's castle
in his dream.</p>

<p>"Impatient for the morning, Martin was at
his bench early working upon the design of the
lock; and when the end of the sixth day arrived,
the time appointed by the stranger for
the delivery of the work, Martin had the lock
completed. Evidently it proved entirely satisfactory
to the stranger, for he paid Marbacher
the money agreed upon, and left the
shop.</p>

<p>"At the corner of the square he stopped before
the larch-tree, bound the iron hoop about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the tree, locked it, put the key in his pocket and
disappeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Time passed. Martin, for some inexplicable
reason, had left Vienna and gone to the
city of Nuremburg where he continued in his
profession. But, one day, he heard that the
Burgomaster of Vienna had offered the title of
master-locksmith to the one who would make
a key which would unlock the iron hoop about
the larch-tree. It was a small task for Martin
to make a duplicate of the key he had once
made, and with it in his pocket he travelled to
Vienna and presented it to the Burgomaster.</p>

<p>"It was a great holiday when the hoop was
to be unbound. Dressed in robes of state,
glistening all over with gold thread and medals,
the Burgomaster and the City Fathers gathered
in the Horsemarket, where stood the Stock im
Eisen; the lock was unfastened and Martin
was created a master-locksmith, much to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
joy of his mother and to the overwhelming
pride of his former master, Herr Marbacher.</p>

<p>"But, although Martin Mux had now acquired
fortune and fame, he was far from being
happy. His bargain with the devil haunted
him; day and night it was with him, for he
feared Sunday morning might come and he
would forget to attend Mass. And then he
would be irretrievably lost. What would
he not give to be able to recall his bargain.
He enjoyed no peace of mind; at his bench
he thought ever of the dreaded day when he
must pay; he could no longer work; he must
not think; he joined his old-time idle companions;
hour after hour was spent in gambling;
night after night he frittered his wealth
away; the more he lost the more desperate he
became; poor Martin Mux was paying dearly
for his game of bowls and his disobedience to
his master.</p>

<p>"One Saturday evening Martin joined his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
comrades quite early, but luck had deserted
him; he lost and lost. One by one the other
habitués of the place had gone until there was
no one left but Martin and his few friends at
the table with him. He paid no heed to time;
all he thought of was to regain some of his lost
money. Suddenly, as had happened some years
before, out on the bowling green, Martin heard
the deep tones of a bell. But this was not the
curfew; it was the church bell calling to Mass.</p>

<p>"Martin looked up from his cards and saw
the sun shining brightly through the curtained
windows. His heart stood still with fright, for
his bargain flashed through his mind; he threw
down the cards and fled into the street, like a
mad man.</p>

<p>"On and on he ran. He brushed past a tall
man, but heeding him not, Martin rushed on.</p>

<p>"'Hurry, my friend,' called out the stranger,
whom he had jostled. 'Hurry, the church bell
has rung; the bargain is paid.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"A malicious laugh rang in Martin's ear.
He turned and saw the evil-eyed stranger, him
of the black velvet cloak and red-plumed cap.</p>

<p>"Mad with fear, Martin bounded up the
church steps. He entered the house of worship;
but the stranger had said truly it was too late;
the bargain was due for the service was ending.
Martin Mux turned to leave the church, but at
the threshold he fell dead; the stranger had
claimed his soul.</p>

<p>"Since that time it has been the custom for
every locksmith apprentice, whether he comes
into Vienna to seek his fortunes, or whether he
goes out from Vienna to other parts, to drive
a nail into the stump of the larch-tree and offer
up a prayer for the peace of Martin Mux's
soul. That is why the old tree is so studded
with nails."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful bargain for Martin to
make!" said Teresa fearfully. "How could
he have given his soul away?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"He chose the easier way out of a small
difficulty, and he paid dearly for it," replied
Herr Müller. "It is not always the easiest
way which is the wisest, after all."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE FARM IN UPPER AUSTRIA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following morning the Müller family
and Teresa Runkel boarded the boat in the
Canal which should take them up current to
Linz. It was most exciting for Ferdinand, who
had never been on the Danube before, but to
Teresa it was quite usual, for she always made
the journey to and from her home by way of
the river.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of excitement upon
the quay&mdash;the fish boats had come in with their
supply for the day, and fishermen were shouting
themselves hoarse in their endeavors to over-shout
their competitors.</p>

<p>The children seated themselves in the bow of
the boat that they might miss nothing of the
scenery which is so delightful near Vienna, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
its green banks, its thick forests and its distant
mountains.</p>

<p>"Do you know what that grim castle is, over
there on the left?" asked Herr Müller.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Teresa quickly. "That
is the Castle of Griefenstein."</p>

<p>"Then you know its history?" asked Herr
Müller.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," answered the child. "Sometimes
the Sister who takes me home tells me,
and sometimes father; but doesn't Ferdinand
know it?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the boy. "I haven't been
on the river before." As if it required some
explanation for his seeming ignorance.</p>

<p>"Then tell it to him, please," said Teresa,
"for it is a splendid tale."</p>

<p>"Long ages ago, this castle belonged to a
lord who was, like all noblemen of that time,
very fond of adventure. Whenever the least
opportunity offered to follow his king, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
take up his sword and his shield and his coat-of-mail,
and hie him off to the wars.</p>

<p>"Now, the lord of the castle had a young
and beautiful wife whose wonderful golden
locks were a never-ending delight to him.
Having a great deal of time upon her hands,
and neighbors being few and far between, the
lady of the castle passed her time in arranging
her magnificent hair in all sorts of fashions,
some very simple, while others were most intricate
and effective.</p>

<p>"It chanced that one day, after an absence
of several months, the lord of the castle returned.
Hastening to his wife's boudoir, he
found her before her mirror dressing her hair
in most bewitching fashion.</p>

<p>"After greeting her, he remarked about her
elaborate head-dress, and laughingly the young
wife asked her husband how he liked it.</p>

<p>"'It is much too handsome,' he replied, 'for
a young woman whose husband is away to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
wars. It is not well for a woman to be so handsome.'</p>

<p>"And without further word, he seized the
sword which hung at his side, removed it from
its scabbard, and with one stroke cut off the
beautiful golden locks of his young wife. But
no sooner had he done so than he was angry
with himself, for his display of temper. He
rushed from the room to cool his anger, when,
whom did he run into, in the corridor, but the
castle chaplain. The poor young lord was so
ashamed of himself for his ungovernable
temper, that, with even less reason than before,
he seized the frightened and astonished chaplain
by the two shoulders, dragged him down
the castle steps and threw him into the dungeon.</p>

<p>"'Now,' said he, after bolting the door securely,
'pray, my good man, that the day may
be hastened when the balustrade of my castle
steps may become so worn by the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
visitors that it may hold the hair of my wife,
which I have cut off in my folly.'</p>

<p>"There is nothing so unreasonable as a man
in anger; I presume had the cook of the castle
chanced to come in the way of milord's anger,
he, too, would have been thrown into the dungeon,
and all would have starved, just to appease
the temper of the impossible lord. Fortunately,
the cook, or the hostler or any of
the knights or attendants of the castle did not
appear, and thus was averted a great calamity.</p>

<p>"When the lord had had time to calm down
a bit, he realized how unjust had been his actions.
It was impossible to restore his wife's
hair, but at least he might release the chaplain.
A castle without a priest is indeed a sorry
place; in his haste to descend the steps to the
dungeon the lord caught his foot; perhaps his
own sword, which had been the means of his
folly, tripped him; in any event, he fell down
the entire flight and was picked up quite dead."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"It served him quite right," interrupted
Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that wasn't the end of the lord, by
any means," continued Herr Müller, smiling.
"He is doomed to wander about his castle until
the balustrade has been worn so deep that it
will hold two heads of hair like those he cut
from his wife. The penitent lord has roamed
about the castle for many a year crying out to
all who pass, 'Grief den Stein! Grief den
Stein!' (Grasp the stone). Long ago he realized
how foolish had been his actions, but although
he has heartily repented, yet may he
never know the rest of his grave until the balustrade
has been worn hollow."</p>

<p>"And does he yet wander there?" asked
Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"So they say; but one cannot see him except
at night. There are many who claim to have
heard him calling out, 'Grief den Stein,' but
although I have been up and down the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
many times, sometimes in the daytime and
sometimes at night, I, myself, have never heard
the ghostly voice."</p>

<p>"I've always felt sorrier for the poor lady
without her beautiful golden hair," observed
Teresa, after a moment's silence, "and I always
felt glad to think the lord had to be punished
for his wickedness; but, somehow, hearing
you tell the story, Herr Müller, I wish his
punishment might not last much longer. For
he was truly sorry, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>Herr Müller looked quizzically at his wife,
and they both turned their heads from the
earnest faces of the children.</p>

<p>"Do you find the old legends of the Danube
interesting, Teresa?" asked Herr Müller, as
the boat sped along, and the children maintained
silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, I love all sorts of tales," the child replied.
"Father tells us some occasionally, but
I am home so little of the time now I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
hear as many as I used to. In the summer-days
we are always so busy at the farm we do not
have the time for story-telling as we do in the
winter-days."</p>

<p>"Austria is full of tales about lords and
ladies, ghosts and towers, but the Danube
legends are not as well known as those of the
Rhine. Have you ever heard that story concerning
the Knight of Rauheneck near
Baaden?"</p>

<p>"No, Herr Müller," replied Teresa.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't much of a tale when you compare
it with the Habsburg legends and the
Griefenstein, and Stock im Eisen, but then it
is worth telling."</p>

<p>"Begin," commanded the young son, in
playful mood.</p>

<p>"Well, near Baaden there stands a formidable
fortress called Rauheneck where lived a
knight in former years. As he was about to
go to war, and might return after many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and perhaps never, he decided to hide the
treasures of the castle and place a spell upon
them so that none might touch them but those
for whom they were intended. So, in secrecy,
he mounted to the summit of the great tower of
the castle and on the battlement he planted a
cherry stone, saying, as he did so:</p>

<p>"'From this stone shall spring forth a tree;
a mighty cherry-tree; from the trunk of the
tree shall be fashioned a cradle; and in that
cradle shall be rocked a young baby, who, in
later years, shall become a priest. To this
priest shall my treasure belong. But even he
may not be able to find the treasure until another
cherry-tree shall have grown upon the
tower, from a stone dropped by a bird of passage.
When all these conditions have been
complied with, then shall the priest find the
treasure at the foot of my tree, and not until
then.'</p>

<p>"Then the careful knight, fearing for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
safety of his treasure, even after such precautions,
called upon a ghost to come and watch
over the castle tower, that peradventure, daring
robbers who might presume to thrust aside the
spells which bound the treasure, would fear to
cope with a ghost."</p>

<p>"And did the priest ever come?" queried
Teresa.</p>

<p>"Not yet, child; the cherry-tree at the top
of the tower is but yet a sapling; there are long
years yet to wait."</p>

<p>"But we don't believe in ghosts, father,"
interrupted Ferdinand. "Why could not
some one go and dig at the root of the
tree and see if the treasure were really
there?"</p>

<p>"One could if he chose, no doubt," answered
Herr Müller, "but no one has."</p>

<p>"Would you, Ferdinand?" asked Teresa.</p>

<p>"Oh, I might, if I were a grown man and
had a lot of soldiers with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know another legend, Herr
Müller?" asked Teresa, shortly.</p>

<p>"Well, there is the legend of Endersdorf in
Moravia.</p>

<p>"A shepherd once lived in the neighborhood,
and although he had always been exceedingly
poor, often almost to the verge of starvation,
yet, one morning, his neighbors found that he
had suddenly become exceedingly rich. Every
one made conjectures concerning the source of
his wealth, but none of them became the confidante
of the shepherd, so that none were ever
the wiser. The erstwhile poor shepherd left
his humble cot and built himself a magnificent
estate and palace upon the spot; he surrounded
himself with retainers and sportsmen and gave
himself up quite naturally to a life of ease and
indolence. Most of his time was spent in following
the hounds; but with all his newly-acquired
wealth, and notwithstanding the memory
of days when a few pence meant a fortune to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
him, the shepherd lost all sense of pity, and
none about the country-side were quite so penurious
and selfish as he. To such poor wayfarers
as accosted him, in mercy's name, to befriend
them, he turned a deaf ear, until his name was
the synonym for all that was miserable and
hard-hearted.</p>

<p>"Now, it happened, that one day a poor beggar
came to the gate of the rich shepherd, asking
for alms. The shepherd was about to leave
the gate in company with a noisy crowd of
hunters and followers, on his way to the chase.
Taking no pity on the poor man's condition, he
suddenly conceived the idea of making the beggar
his prey.</p>

<p>"'Here is sport for us, good men,' he cried.
'Let us drive the beggar before us with our
whips, and see him scamper lively.'</p>

<p>"Whereupon, following the action of their
host, the entire company raised their whips, set
spurs to their horses, and drove the trembling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
frightened, outraged man from before
them.</p>

<p>"'Now has your hour come,' cried out the
old man, as he turned and defied his assailants.
'May all the curses of Heaven fall upon your
heads, ye hard-hearted lot of roysterers!'</p>

<p>"At the word, the sky, which had before
been cloudless, grew suddenly black; the lightning
flashed; the thunder rolled; the very
ground under their feet, shook, cracked and
opened, swallowing the shepherd, his followers,
their horses, dogs, and every vestige of the estate
vanished. In its place arose a lake
whose dark waters tossed and moaned in
strange fashion.</p>

<p>"On stormy days, even to this present day,
when the waters of the lake are lashing themselves
in fury, the shepherd of the hard heart
can be seen passing across the waves, his whip
raised to strike some unseen object, a black
hunting dog behind him. How long his punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
may last, no one knows, but he can always
be seen just as he was when the earthquake
swallowed him up."</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange," observed Teresa, "but
every one of the tales end in the punishment of
the wicked knight."</p>

<p>"Of course," remarked Ferdinand. "They
wouldn't be tales at all if the wrong-doer was
allowed to go free. Would they, father?"</p>

<p>"Indeed not; but now it's time for breakfast.
Would you like to eat on deck? It is
so perfect a day, it is a pity to go indoors."</p>

<p>This suggestion appealed wonderfully to the
children, and Herr Müller left them to order
the meal served upon the deck.</p>

<p>As night fell, the boat docked at Linz. Herr
Runkel was waiting on the quay with a heavy
wagon and a team of horses to drive them to
the farm. It was a beautiful drive in the bright
moonlight, and the lights of Linz twinkled below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
them, while the Danube sparkled in the
distance, just like a fairy world.</p>

<p>It was very late when they reached the farm-house;
Frau Runkel greeted them cordially,
and immediately after helping them off with
their wraps, poured out steaming hot coffee to
warm them up, the night air having been a
trifle chilly.</p>

<p>Ferdinand went directly to his room after
coffee was served. It was on the opposite side
of the house, on the ground floor; the farm-house
was but one story high, with a lofty attic
above. In one corner of the large bedroom
stood a canopied bed of dark wood, elaborately
painted in bright colors, on head and foot board,
with designs of flowers and birds. There were
two small, stiff-backed wooden chairs, a night-table,
upon which stood a brass candlestick, and
an enormous wardrobe or chest for his clothes.
All the furnishings of the room, even to the
rug by the bed, were the handiwork of the occupants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of the farm-house, for no true Austrian
peasant would condescend to purchase these
household necessities from a shop. Between
two voluminous feather beds Ferdinand slept
soundly, nor did he stir until he heard voices
in the garden. Hastily dressing, he made
his way into the living-room, where breakfast
had already been partaken of by the
others.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry to be late," he apologized,
shamefacedly. "Why didn't you call me,
mother?" he asked, as he turned to the one
who must naturally share the responsibility of
her children's shortcomings.</p>

<p>"We thought to let you have your rest,"
answered Frau Müller. "Your day will be
very full. You evidently enjoyed your downy
bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was great; let <i>us</i> get one, mother."</p>

<p>"I used to sleep under one when I was a
girl," replied Frau Müller, "but no one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
city uses them any more; the woolly blankets
have quite superceded them."</p>

<p>"You may take yours home with you, if you
like," said Frau Runkel, "we have geese
enough to make more."</p>

<p>"Now," said Herr Runkel, "if you are all
ready, we'll go over and pay our respects to
father and mother."</p>

<p>"Then your parents do not live with you?"
asked Herr Müller, a little astonished.</p>

<p>"No, that is not the custom among us. You
see, when I got married, father made over the
farm and all its appurtenances to me, being the
eldest son; then he built himself another home,
just over in the field, there," and Herr Runkel
pointed to a tiny, cosy cottage some few hundred
paces away.</p>

<p>"What a splendid thing to be the eldest son,"
remarked Herr Müller.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is," replied his host, "but it entails
a great responsibility, as well. You see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
after the ceremony of deeding the farm away to
me, <i>I</i> am called upon to settle an allowance
upon my parents during their lifetime."</p>

<p>"That's but right," assented Herr Müller,
"seeing that they have given you everything
they possess, and which they have acquired with
such toil and privation."</p>

<p>"Yes, but father received the farm from his
father, in just the same manner; although he
has enlarged it, so that it is bigger and better.
But, in addition to father and mother," continued
the farmer, "I have all my brothers and
sisters to look after. There is Teresa at the
convent in Vienna; there is Frederick at the
Gymnasium in Linz; and there is Max an apprentice
in Zara; these must all be cared for;
and, I can tell you, Müller, it's a responsible
position, that of being the eldest son."</p>

<p>"But you weren't called upon, Franz," replied
his friend, "to provide so bountifully for
each."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but what would you have?" he replied.
"I have tried to be a dutiful son; and," he
added, his eyes twinkling as he glanced at his
wife, "I've been sort of lenient towards father
and the children, because father let me off so
lightly when he boxed my ears for the last
time."</p>

<p>"Boxed your ears?" exclaimed Herr Müller,
in astonishment. "What <i>had</i> you done to deserve
such disgrace?"</p>

<p>"Well, that was part of the ceremony.
When the farm was made over to me, it's the
custom, before signing the deed, for the owner
to make the rounds of his estate with his family;
when he comes to each of the four corner-posts,
he boxes the ears of the new owner. Now,
father might have boxed mine roundly, had he
chosen, for I was somewhat of a rollicker in my
youth," and the genial farmer chuckled softly,
"but father was sparing of my feelings. Don't
you believe he deserved a recompense?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"He certainly did," answered his friend, and
they all laughed heartily over the matter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they had gained the entrance
to the dower-house, as the home of the aged
couple was called. As Herr Müller had not
seen the parents of his friend since childhood
there were many years of acquaintanceship to
bridge over; and Ferdinand, fascinated, listened
to the conversation, for this old couple
were most interesting persons to talk with.</p>

<p>After returning from church the family
gathered on the wide verandah under the eaves,
the women with their knitting, which is not
considered improper even on Sundays among
Austrian women.</p>

<p>This verandah in the peasant home in Upper
Austria is a most important part of the house.
It is protected from the elements by the enormous
overhanging eaves above, running the
entire side of the house; heavy timbers support
it, green with growing vines which climb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
from the porch boxes filled with gayly blossoming
flowers. It is a tiny garden brought to
one's sitting-room; the birds twitter in the sunlight,
as they fly in and out of their nests under
the eaves; and here the neighbors gossip and
drink coffee and munch delicious cakes. In
fact, it is the sole sitting-room of the family
during warm days, for no peasant woman
would think of shutting herself in a room to
do her work. One can always work to better
advantage in the sunlight and open air.</p>

<p>The children rambled about the farm and
outbuildings. The farm-house was very long
and deep and low, with a long, slanting roof.
The front door was of heavy timbers upon
which was a design of St. Martin outlined in
nails, the work of the farmer, while small
crosses at either side of the door were considered
sufficient protection from the evil
spirits who might wish to attack the family
within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The interior of the farm-house was very
simple; a large vestibule called the Laube or
bower served as a means of communication between
the different parts of the house; the
sleeping-rooms were ranged on one side, while
the dining and living-room occupied the other,
with the kitchen just beyond.</p>

<p>The Gesindestube, or living-room, was very
plain, with its bare floors and darkened walls;
a tile stove in one corner, benches about the
walls and chests, some plain, some elaborately
decorated and carved, occupied whatever space
was left. Here were kept the household linens
and the wardrobes for the family, as no Austrian
peasant home is built with closets as we
have in America.</p>

<p>That evening, Herr Runkel said to Ferdinand:</p>

<p>"To-morrow, my boy, we work. Would you
like to help?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it would be jolly," replied the lad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
After a moment's hesitation, he added: "What
kind of work? Hoeing potatoes or weeding
the garden?"</p>

<p>These two tasks were the only ones the lad
was familiar with upon his uncle's farm in
Tyrol.</p>

<p>The farmer laughed. "No, we won't do
that," he said. "We'll leave that to the servants;
but we'll make shoes."</p>

<p>"Make shoes!" exclaimed the child, incredulously.
"Really make them yourself?
I've never made shoes," he added, doubting
whether he might be allowed now to assist.</p>

<p>"Why not?" answered Herr Runkel.
"You know we are very old-fashioned here;
and, as we have so far to go to the shops, why
we don't go; we let the workmen come to us.
This is an off-time of the season; so we have
the tailors and the shoemakers and all sorts of
folk come and help us with such things as we
can't do ourselves, for, you know, we make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
everything we use on the farm, and everything
we wear."</p>

<p>"Oh, how fine," said Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we have jolly times, too," continued
the farmer, "for when work is over
we play. Isn't that right?"</p>

<p>Ferdinand went to bed that night with visions
of tailors and shoemakers and harnessmakers
and whatnot, in his head, until he fell asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE PEASANTS' DANCE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span> needed no call to arouse him in
the morning. He was awake and up long before
any of his family, but he did not catch
Herr Runkel nor his buxom wife, napping.</p>

<p>"Come along, Ferdinand, and help me get
the leather ready for the men," said the farmer,
and he led the way across the garden to a great
timber building, two stories in height. He
opened the door, and they entered a very large
room, with a decided smoky smell about it.</p>

<p>"What is this?" asked Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"This is our Feld-kasten (field-box) where
we keep all our supplies. Here are the seeds
for planting when the time comes; here are
the hams and bacons and dried meat for use
during the winter; here is the lard for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
year;" and Herr Runkel took off the lids of the
great casks and showed the white lard to the
child, astonished beyond expression, at this collection
of supplies.</p>

<p>"And what's in the loft?" asked the boy,
seeing the substantial ladder leading thereto.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's for the women-folks," he replied.
"We keep all sorts of things there.
Let's go up."</p>

<p>And they ascended.</p>

<p>The loft was a room full of shelves; in most
delightful order were ranged bundles of white
cotton cloth, bundles of flax for spinning,
bundles of woolen goods for making up into
apparel, some dyed and some in the natural
wool; there were rows and rows of yarn for
embroidering the garments of the peasants, and
upon the floor in one corner was a great heap
of leather, with all sorts of machinery, and harness,
and Ferdinand never <i>could</i> learn what
there was not here, so overwhelmed was he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here we are," said Herr Runkel, as he
tugged at the pile of leather. "We must get
this out, for the shoemakers start after breakfast.
Give us a lift, child," and he half
dragged, half lifted the leather to the trap-door
and let it slide down the ladder.</p>

<p>For days afterwards Ferdinand was in a fever
of excitement. First he would help cut out the
leather for the heavy farm shoes, working the
best he could with his inexperience; the main
thing being to keep busy, and he certainly accomplished
it. Then he helped the tailors, for
every one who could be spared about the farm
joined in the tasks of the journeymen, that they
might finish their work and move on to another
farm, before the busy season should begin for
the farmers.</p>

<p>It is customary in addition to the low wages
of about twelve cents a day for servants to
receive their clothing, as part payment, so that
upon a large farm, of the extent of Herr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Runkel's, there were many to be provided for.
Frau Müller assisted Frau Runkel in the
kitchen, where Teresa, too, was kept busy;
even Ferdinand not disdaining to make himself
useful in that department.</p>

<p>At length the journeymen were finished, and
Herr Müller spoke about leaving in a few days
for Tyrol.</p>

<p>"We shall have a merrymaking, then, before
you go," said his host. "But I presume
parties are not a novelty to you; are they,
Ferdinand? City folks, especially Viennese,
are very gay."</p>

<p>"Oh, we never have parties in Vienna," replied
the lad. "That is, private parties; they
cost too much. But we have our masked balls
and ice festivals. Of course I can't go to those;
they are only for grown folks."</p>

<p>Herr Müller took up the thread of conversation
at this point. "Vienna, with all its glitter,
is but a poor city, after all," he said. "Living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is very costly; the rich and the aristocracy have
impoverished themselves by their extravagant
ways of living. They dwell in fine homes, wear
gorgeous uniforms and gowns, but cannot pay
for these extravagances. They have shooting-lodges
in the mountains, country villas for the
summer, besides their town homes, but they
have the fear constantly over their heads that
these will be taken from them, to redeem the
mortgages upon them."</p>

<p>"I am more than ever thankful," replied the
farmer, "that I have my farm and my family,
and owe no man."</p>

<p>"You are certainly right," answered his
friend. "It is to such men as you that Austria
must look in the future."</p>

<p>"But about the party, Herr Runkel," interrupted
Ferdinand, who feared that his host
might forget his suggestion.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Well, we'll have that Saturday
night; so run along and help the women-folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
get ready for it, for you never saw such feasts
as we do have at our parties, child."</p>

<p>Ferdinand, being just a boy, rushed off to the
kitchen to provide for the "spread" that was
to come, and he and Teresa chattered like two
magpies over the splendid prospect.</p>

<p>Although Ferdinand Müller did not quite believe
that Saturday afternoon would ever come,
it eventually did come; and a perfect day, too.
Teresa was dressed in her most shining silver
buckles and her whitest of homespun stockings,
while Frau Runkel outshone every one in the
room with her gayly embroidered apron over
her dark skirt, and her overwhelming display of
hand-made silver ornaments in her ears, upon
her arms, about her neck, and on her fingers.
And her head-dress was a marvel to behold,
glistening with gold thread and shining with
tiny beads of various colors.</p>

<p>The table was set in the Gesindestube; there
were roast ducks, and geese and chickens, roast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
meats and stewed meats, and Wienerschnitzel
(veal cutlet), without which no Austrian home
is complete. There were sausage and cheese and
black bread and noodles; there were cakes with
white frosting and pink frosting, and some
were decorated with tiny colored seeds like
caraway-seeds. Never had Ferdinand beheld
such a sight before; but truly the Austrian
peasant knows how to enjoy life.</p>

<p>The reception over, the host and hostess led
the way to the dining-table, the men placing
themselves on the bench on one side while the
women sat opposite them on the other. With
bowed heads, the host said the grace; then began
the gayety. There was no constraint; each
helped himself and his neighbor bountifully.
Meanwhile, the two young children, at the foot
of the board, were not neglected, but kept up
a lively conversation of their own, utterly oblivious
of their elders.</p>

<p>"Wait until the dessert comes," said Teresa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
"Did you ever see one of these nettle-cakes?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/i091.jpg" width="362" height="500" alt="Woman carrying large dessert into table" />
<div class="caption">"IT TOWERED HIGH ABOVE HER HEAD."</div>
</div>

<p>"Nettle-cakes?" repeated the lad. "What
is that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you will see," replied the young lady,
looking wise. "But be careful, I warn you, not
to prick your fingers. Perhaps, though," she
added, "mother may not allow us to join in,
for this is a special feast-day, in honor of you
and your parents."</p>

<p>Ferdinand was not kept long in suspense.
The viands having been disposed of to the satisfaction
of every one, the maid brought in the
"pièce de resistance." It towered high above
her head, and had she not been brought up in
the open air of the country she certainly never
would have had the strength to manage such a
burden. Upon a huge wooden dish was piled
high fresh fruits from the orchard, cakes with
delicious frosting, nuts and bright flowers. It
was a medley of color, set off by great streamers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of gay ribbons and bows; quite like a bridal
cake, but vastly more interesting.</p>

<p>Tongues wagged fast, you may be sure; all
wished to get a chance at the gorgeous centrepiece,
nevertheless, they all waited for their
host's approval, and, waiting his opportunity,
when many were not on the alert, he raised his
hand, and then such a scramble you never saw
in all your days. The men rose out of their
seats and grabbed for one particular sweetmeat,
which might appeal to the palate of his
fair partner; but for all their precautions,
knowing the hidden secrets of the dessert, many
emerged from the battle with scratched hands
or bleeding fingers, for these delicious cakes
and luscious fruits covered prickly nettles, a
trap for the unskilful.</p>

<p>But what mattered these trifles to the happy-hearted
peasant folk. They chatted and
laughed and dived for fruit and decked the hair
of their favorites with gay flowers, or cracked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
nuts with their knife handles and fed them to
their lady loves. With the coffee, the feast
ended.</p>

<p>Carrying the benches to the sides of the
room, where they ordinarily reposed, the table
was cleared as if by magic. Now the dance
was on. Zithers and violins appeared, and the
darkened rafters of the Gesindestube rang with
the clatter of many feet.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock all was quiet at the farm-house;
the guests had complimented their host
and hostess upon the success of the evening,
and the elaborateness of the table; they bade
farewell to the Müller family, and saying good
night to all, made their way over the fields,
singing with hearty voices, their tuneful folk-songs;
and thus Ferdinand heard the last of
them ere he fell asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>SOME TYROLESE LEGENDS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following morning Herr and Frau
Müller and Ferdinand bade their kind host and
hostess good-by and they set out for Linz,
where they would take the train to Innsbruck,
the capital of Upper Tyrol. Ferdinand was
very loth to leave the farm, he had had such a
splendid time there, and felt that he had not
seen half of the farm-life; but Herr Runkel
promised that he should come again the following
summer and spend the entire vacation
with them, to which his parents consented, so
the child was content. However, he was to
visit his cousin Leopold, and that was always a
treat, for Tyrol is so charming and so different
from other spots in Austria, it would be a difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
child, indeed, to please, who would not be
content with a trip to Tyrol.</p>

<p>Herr Hofer and his son Leopold met them
at the station in Innsbruck, with a heavy wagon
and two strong horses; the Hofers lived in
Volders in the Unter-Innthal or valley of the
Lower Inn River, some distance in the mountains;
all the country to the north of the Inn
being designated as the Upper and that to the
south, as the Lower valley.</p>

<p>"Have you had your luncheon?" asked
Herr Hofer, as soon as the greetings were over.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we lunched on board the train,"
replied Herr Müller.</p>

<p>"Then, let's get off," said Herr Hofer, "for
we have a long drive before us." He pulled his
horses' reins and the beasts started off at a good
pace.</p>

<p>Leaving the station, they turned down the
Margareth-platz with its fountain of dragons
and griffins, where young women were filling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
their pitchers, for Innsbruck is very primitive in
many of its customs. Down the broad and
splendid Maria-Theresa Strasse the carriage
turned, and stopped before a most gorgeous
palace, whose roof shone in the bright sunshine
like molten metal.</p>

<p>"Oh, uncle, who can live in such a beautiful
house?" asked Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"That is the Goldne Dachl, or the House
with the Golden Roof," replied his uncle. "It
was built ever so many years ago by our beloved
Count Frederick of Tyrol. You've heard
of him?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied the lad. "But I don't
know about this house of his."</p>

<p>"Well, Count Frederick was a most generous
man; he would lend to all his friends who
were not always very prompt in repaying him,
and sometimes forget they owed him anything
at all. At length, his enemies began to call him
the Count of the Empty Pockets. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
very unjust, for poor Friedl (that's what we
call him, who love him, you know) had had a
very hard time of it, indeed. His own brother
had driven him from his throne and usurped it
himself, and made it a crime for any one to
even shelter poor Friedl, who wandered about
from place to place like the veriest vagabond.
But, at length, he discovered that he had many
friends who longed to show their devotion to
him; he made a stand for his rights and secured
his throne. But still, the nickname did not
leave him. So, just to prove to his people that
he was unjustly called the Count of the Empty
Pockets, he ordered this wonderful roof of gold
to be put on his palace. They say it cost him
$70,000, which certainly was a great sum for
a man with empty pockets."</p>

<p>Turning the horses' heads in the opposite
direction, Herr Hofer conducted them through
the Triumphal Arch and gained the country
road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought to show the boys the Abbey of
Wilten," explained Herr Hofer, as they trotted
along, "and perhaps stop at Schloss Amras,
as we may not have an opportunity soon
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, uncle," cried Ferdinand, "I love to
see old ruins and castles. We have a lot of
fine ones about Vienna, but they are all
alike."</p>

<p>"Well, these will be quite different, I can
assure you," replied his uncle.</p>

<p>The two boys occupied the rear seat with
Frau Müller, while the fathers sat upon the
front. And verily the little tongues wagged as
only boys' tongues can do. In the midst of
their spirited conversation, the carriage stopped
before a splendid old church.</p>

<p>"Oh, father," exclaimed Ferdinand, "what
queer looking men!"</p>

<p>Herr Müller looked about, but saw no one.</p>

<p>"Where?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, there, by the sides of the church
door."</p>

<p>Both men laughed.</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> queer looking, aren't they?" said
Uncle Hofer. "But you would think it a lot
queerer did you know how they came to be
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, tell us," the boy exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well, once upon a time, way back in the
Middle Ages, there were two giants who lived
in different parts of the earth. Each of them
was twelve feet or more tall; one was called
Haymo and the other Tirsus. Now, in those
times, giants did not remain quietly in their
strongholds; they set out on adventures; so it
chanced that, in the course of their travels,
these two mighty giants encountered each other,
right on this spot where this abbey stands.
But of course, there was no abbey here then;
the ancient Roman town of Veldidena was hereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, when the two giants met, they
stopped, looked one at the other and measured
his strength. Well, it naturally fell about
that they decided to prove their strength; in
the struggle, sad to tell, Haymo killed Tirsus.
Poor giant Haymo. Big as he was, he wept, for
he had not meant to harm his giant comrade.
At length, to ease his mind, he determined to
build an abbey on the spot, as that seemed to be
the solace for all evils, in those days. And then
Haymo would become a monk, and for eighteen
whole years he would weep and weep as penance
for the deed.</p>

<p>"But poor Haymo had more than he bargained
for. He did not know that the Devil
had claimed this same spot; no sooner did
Haymo bring the stones for the foundation of
his church than the Devil came and pulled them
down. But Haymo persisted, for he really
must keep his vow; and evidently he conquered
the Devil himself, for the abbey stands, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
see, and these are the two statues of the giants
guarding the portal of the church, so that the
Devil may not come, I suppose."</p>

<div class="caption">STATUE OF ANDREAS HOFER, NEAR INNSBRUCK.</div>
</div>

<p>"Poor Haymo," said Ferdinand. "What a
hardship to weep for eighteen years, <i>nicht wahr</i>,
Leopold?"</p>

<p>"<i>Yawohl</i>," came the stolid reply, while the
two men chuckled softly.</p>

<p>It is a peculiarity of Tyrol that, not until one
attains middle age at least, does he begin to
appreciate humor the least bit. Children are
always too serious to admit of "fun" in their
prosaic lives, so that, were it not for the elderly
people, humor might eventually die out altogether
in Tyrol, so serious a nation are they.</p>

<p>"Shall we go inside, father?" asked Leopold.</p>

<p>"We have not time; night will overtake us,
and we must go on to Schloss Amras yet.
There really is little to see, however."</p>

<p>And while the lads strained their necks and
eyes to catch a glimpse of the beautiful paintings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
upon the outside walls of the abbey, the
wonderful gilding and stucco, the horses disappeared
around a bend in the road, and it was
lost to sight.</p>

<p>Now they commenced to climb, for the road
is always up and up in Tyrol. Below them lay
the wonderful view of Innsbruck, with the Inn
running gayly along; there, too, was the fair
abbey with its two giants carved in stone, watching
ever at the portal.</p>

<p>"Have you boys any idea where we are?"
asked Herr Hofer.</p>

<p>Both shook their heads negatively.</p>

<p>"All this country hereabouts is alive with
interest attaching to Andreas Hofer, our
patriot," replied he. "Here, at this very Gasthaus
(inn) was where he made his last effort
against the enemy. We shall learn more of it
as we go along," he continued, "but there is not
much use to stop here now. We go a few steps
further to the Schloss."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Truly it was a delightful old place, this castle
of Amras, one of the few feudal castles left.
There was an old courtyard paved with great
stones, there were battlements and towers and
relics of Roman invasions. The guide led them
through the castle, room after room, filled with
most interesting articles of every description
pertaining to ancient times and wars, all of
which intensely absorbed the boys' attention.</p>

<p>"Oh, what an immense bowl!" cried Ferdinand.
"And of glass. What is it for?"</p>

<p>"That is the welcome bowl," replied the attendant.
"We call it, nowadays, the loving
cup. In every castle there were many like this;
there was a gold one for ladies, a silver one for
princes and a glass one for knights, which latter
was the largest of all. When guests came to
the castle, the welcome bowl was brought out,
filled to the brim and handed to the guest, who
was supposed to drink it off at a draught, if he
was at all of a hazardous or knightly disposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
To his undoing, it sometimes happened
he did not survive the ordeal; but that mattered
not at all to him; he had displayed his
bravery and that was worth life itself. After
the bowl was drained, a great book was brought
out, in which the guest was requested to write
his name, no doubt as a test as to his real station,
for no one but the highest and noblest
were able to write or read in those times, and
it often chanced even they were unable to do
so."</p>

<p>"Why, that is what they do in hotels!" said
Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the guide, "and probably
that is where the custom originated, for the
manager of a hotel but preserves the ancient
custom of registering the names of his guests."</p>

<p>All too soon the visit came to an end; the
party made its way to the near-by inn to spend
the night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>MORE LEGENDS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inn-keeper, Herr Schmidt, was a big,
raw-boned man with a red face and a jolly air.
He was a genuine Wirthe or inn-keeper of the
old-time; and after supper, as they all sat in the
great sitz-saal together, he told them wonderful
tales of the country round about, which so
abounded in legends and folk-lore. As the
position of Wirthe descends from father to son,
for generations back, as long as there remains
any sons to occupy that honored position, naturally,
too, the legends are passed from one to
the other, so that no one is quite so well able
to recite these as our hearty friend Herr
Schmidt.</p>

<p>"If it were not so late," remarked Herr
Hofer, while the men sat and smoked their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
long, curious pipes, "I should continue on to
Volders, for it looks as if to-morrow might be
stormy."</p>

<p>"Oh, you need have no fear as to that," replied
the host. "I noticed Frau Hütte did not
have her night-cap on."</p>

<p>Ferdinand looked at his little cousin with his
face so puckered up with glee and merriment,
that Leopold laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Do tell Ferdinand about Frau Hütte,
father!" said the child.</p>

<p>"No, I think Herr Wirthe better able to do
that. Bitte," and he saluted the inn-keeper in
deference.</p>

<p>"And have you never heard of Frau Hütte,
my boy?" asked the host.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the boy. "You know I
live in Vienna."</p>

<p>"Well, everybody knows her," replied the
inn-keeper; "but then, you are a little young
yet, so I will tell you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very long ago, in the time of giants and
fairies,&mdash; But then you don't believe in
fairies, do you?" and the fellow's eyes
sparkled keenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do," exclaimed the boy hastily,
for fear if he denied the existence of such beings,
he should miss a good story.</p>

<p>"Well, then, there was a queen over the
giants who was called Frau Hütte."</p>

<p>"Oh," interrupted the lad, "then she isn't a
real person?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she was; but that was long ago,"
continued the story teller. "Well, Frau Hütte
had a young son who was very much like any
other little child; he wanted whatever he
wanted, and he wanted it badly. One day,
this giant child took a notion he should like to
have a hobby horse. Without saying a word to
any one, he ran off to the edge of the forest
and chopped himself a fine large tree. But evidently
the child did not know much about felling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
trees, for this one fell over and knocked
him into the mud. With loud cries, he ran
home to his mother. Instead of punishing him,
she bade the nurse wipe off the mud with a
piece of white bread. No one but the very
richest could afford the luxury of white bread,
black bread being considered quite good enough
for ordinary consumption, so no wonder the
mountain began to shake and the lightning to
flash, just as soon as the maid started to obey
her mistress' command.</p>

<p>"Frau Hütte was so frightened at this unexpected
storm that she picked up her son in
her arms and made for the mountain peak some
distance from her palace. No sooner had she
left the palace than it disappeared from view,
even to the garden, and nothing was ever seen
of it again. But even in her retreat the wasteful
queen was not secure. When she had seated
herself upon the rock, she became a stone
image, holding her child in her arms. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
there she sits to this day. When the clouds
hover about her head then we know there will
be a storm, but when Frau Hütte does not wear
her night-cap," and the Wirthe's eyes sparkled,
"then we are certain of clear weather."</p>

<p>"Ever since then, the Tyrolese have made
Frau Hütte the theme of a proverb 'Spart eure
Brosamen fur die Armen, damit es euch nicht
ergehe wie der Frau Hütte,' which really means
'Spare your crumbs for the poor, so that you do
not fare like Frau Hütte,' a lesson to the extravagant."</p>

<p>There were endless more stories, all of which
delighted the boys immensely, but we could not
begin to relate them all, for Tyrol is so overladen
with the spirit of the past, and with the
charm of legend, that the very air itself breathes
of fairies and giants, and days of yore, so that
in invading its territory one feels he is no longer
in this work-a-day world, but in some enchanted
spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Early the next morning, up with the sun, all
were ready for the drive home. As Herr
Wirthe had predicted, the day was fair; as they
drove away from the Inn, they caught a glimpse
of Frau Hütte in the distance beyond Innsbruck,
and, sure enough, there she sat on her
mountain peak, with her great son safely sheltered
in her arms.</p>

<p>"Shall we go to the salt mines, father?"
asked Leopold, as they made their way along
the mountain road.</p>

<p>"No, we cannot take the time; mother will
be waiting for us and the women folks are impatient
to visit, I know."</p>

<p>"They have wonderful salt mines at Salzburg,"
said Ferdinand. "Perhaps we may go
there some time to visit them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied his father. "But, while
we are on the subject, did it ever occur to you
that Salzburg means the 'town or castle of
salt?'&mdash;for, in the old times, all towns were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
within castle-walls, to protect them from depredations
of the enemy."</p>

<p>"Isn't it curious?" meditated Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The Inn River crossed, they continued to
climb. Herr Hofer stopped to rest the horses;
he glanced about him at the panorama below,
and chuckled mirthfully.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, uncle?" asked Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much; but every time I see
the towns of Hall and Thaur, just over there,"
and he pointed with the handle of his whip,
"I think of the Bauernkrieg."</p>

<p>"But there isn't anything very funny about
a war, is there, uncle?" asked the serious little
fellow.</p>

<p>"Well," rambled on his uncle, "there was
about <i>this</i> one. You see, in early times, when
Tyrol was not quite so peaceful as it is to-day,
these two cities were most jealous of each
other, and were always at feud. A watchman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
stood on the tower, day and night, to prevent
any surprise from his neighbor. One night, in
midsummer,&mdash;and a very hot night it was,
too,&mdash;the people of Hall were roused from
their slumbers, if they had been able to sleep
at all in such heat, by the voice of the watchman
calling them to arms.</p>

<p>"'What is the trouble, watchman?' cried
one and all, as they appeared at their windows.</p>

<p>"'Oh,' exclaimed the frightened fellow,
'hasten, friends, hasten! The whole town of
Thaur is at our gates; and not only are they
advancing toward us, but each man boldly carries
a lantern.'</p>

<p>"Such audacity was never heard of before.
In utmost consternation the people gathered
in the village square and held a consultation.
It was finally arranged that Herr Zott, the
steward of the salt mine, and therefore a most
important personage in the village, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
meet the enemy with a flag of truce and demand
the reason for this unexpected attack.
The inhabitants of Hall, in fear and trembling,
awaited Herr Zott's return.</p>

<p>"The truce-bearer left the city gates and
proceeded into the plain, which separated their
village from the enemy's. On and on he went;
but not one soul did he meet. The great army
of men, each carrying a lantern, had disappeared
as if by magic. Finally he reached the
walls of Thaur, where all was as quiet as it
should be at that time of the night.</p>

<p>"He turned his horse's head homeward.
The night was very still, and over the plain
flashed the lights of thousands of fireflies,
reveling in the warm summer breeze. It was
not until he had reached the very gates of his
own town that Herr Zott realized what had
caused all the excitement. The watchman had
mistaken the fireflies for lanterns; and naturally,
as some one must carry the lanterns, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
more probable than their enemy, the people of
Thaur?</p>

<p>"The townsfolks betook themselves to their
beds again, laughing heartily over the mistake;
and even to this day we laugh over the incident
which has become a by-word in Tyrol; Bauernkrieg,
or the peasant's war."</p>

<p>"But I don't see how peasant's war can
mean anything now," said Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"Well, when one becomes excited over nothing,"
returned his uncle, "they exclaim
'Bauernkrieg.' Some day you will hear it,
and then you will recollect the origin of it."</p>

<p>Not long after this tale, the carriage stopped
in front of a most charming home on the mountainside.
The first story was stuccoed, while
across the entire front and two sides of the
second and third stories ran a wide wooden
balcony. Boxes of red and white geraniums
decked the top of the fancy balustrade, while
vines trailed themselves far over, giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
house a most "homey" appearance. The
lower story receded far behind the overhanging
second story, which formed a convenient
space for sheltering the cattle. There is little
available space in Tyrol for outbuildings, the
mountains rising so precipitously that there is
but little level. But, as stone floors separate
the house from the stable, odors do not penetrate
as much as one would imagine.</p>

<p>At the front of the house stood a woman of
middle age, her hair carefully drawn back under
an immense head-dress, so tall it seemed as if
she would be unable to enter the doorway.
She wore a black skirt, so very full it had the
appearance of being a hoop-skirt; but this
effect was produced by her ten extremely full
petticoats. The reputation of a Tyrolese
woman depends, in a great degree, to the number
of petticoats she wears; sometimes young
girls, who value modesty highly, wear as many
as fifteen or more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Over the black skirt, which showed to advantage
the white stockings and low shoes with
their shining buckles of silver, was a most
elaborately embroidered black apron, the work
of many hours of tedious labor for the housewife.
About her waist was twined a bright
yellow sash which brightened up the dark
bodice, with its short sleeves tied fantastically
with bright yellow ribbons.</p>

<p>The woman nodded to the travelers; Herr
Hofer pulled up his horses and descended from
the carriage.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>meine liebe frau</i>, here we are," said
he, as he greeted his wife.</p>

<p>Such hugging as followed! Ferdinand was
clasped time and again against the ample
bosom of Frau Hofer, and even Herr Müller
came in for a goodly share, while as for the
greeting that Frau Müller received, no words
may convey its warmth.</p>

<p>The party made its way up the narrow stairway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
with carved balustrade, which led from the
ground floor to the second story, upon the outside
of the house. This is the most convenient
manner of building staircases in Tyrol, because
it does not track mud and dirt through the corridors,
and saves much interior space.</p>

<p>The guest-room was certainly restful looking.
Its dark polished floor of pine had been
newly polished until it fairly radiated; the big
bed of wood, painted a vivid color of green,
also had received scrupulous polishing; two
small home-made rugs, one at the bedside, the
other at the washstand, had been scrubbed and
beaten until it seemed as if there would be
nothing left of them. At the side of the canopied
bed stood a tiny foot-stool: the Tyrolese
beds being extremely high make the use of a
stool necessary. No doubt the object of this
is to avoid draughts, as none of the floors are
carpeted, many being of cement. Immaculate
white curtains hung at the casement windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
those dear little windows, unlike anything we
have in America, which open into the room and
give such a cosy character to the home. A
basin of Holy Water was hung in its accustomed
place, and the image of the Virgin hung over
the table; for, you must know, the Tyrolese are
devout Roman Catholics, as, in fact, are nearly
all the natives of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>A NIGHT WITH THE SENNER</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Merry</span> days followed; there were excursions
almost every day. Ferdinand and Leopold
would spend part of the time picking flowers
on the mountain-sides, or would help with the
cattle and in the garden, so that their elders
might be able to devote more time to recreation
with their guests.</p>

<p>One morning the two men and boys set out
with rücksacks on their shoulders, and long
alpenstocks in their hands, to climb the mountain
and visit an "alp" in the pasture lands,
for in the summertime the cows of the neighboring
villagers are driven to pasture in charge of
a few attendants, sometimes men, called senner,
sometimes women, called sennerin, where they
remain during the entire season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you never seen the senner<i>ei</i>, Ferdinand?"
asked his cousin.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Don't you remember the last time
I was here," replied Ferdinand, "we saw them
drive the cattle away?"</p>

<p>"But I said the senner<i>ei</i> (dairy)," repeated
the child.</p>

<p>"No, but I should love to see the cheeses
made; the alps look so picturesque."</p>

<p>"Well, they aren't quite so nice when you
reach them," admitted his cousin; "however,
we are not going specially to see the dairy but
the dance which the sennern have on Saturday
night. Oh, it's great."</p>

<p>"Do they have one every Saturday
night?"</p>

<p>"Very near, as long as the season lasts;
it's wonderful, Ferdinand. I've seen some
of the fellows do the most astonishing
tricks."</p>

<p>Of course, such conversation stimulated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
city lad's desire to a great pitch; and it was with
the keenest joy he tramped over the rocky
mountains, which was difficult for him. But
he said nothing; he kept before his mind the
delights of the dance he should witness, and
plodded on.</p>

<p>At length they reached the first "alp," or
chalet, as the huts which serve for sleeping-room
and dairy for the sennern are called.
These chalets are built at different heights up
the mountain; when the cattle have eaten all
the green grass available at one level they
are driven to the next higher pasture and
so on until, towards the beginning of November,
they return to the village for the
winter.</p>

<p>Picturesque as the "alp" may look from
the distance, it is scarce one of grandeur upon
closer view. It consists of a low wooden hut,
usually of one room, and a sort of adjoining
alcove. In the main room is a bunk built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
against the wall; nothing but straw serves for
the mattress; there are no coverlets except the
blanket the senner always carries with him, and
in which he wraps himself. In another part of
this uninviting room is a hollowed space where
the fire is built, over which hangs a great crane
and an iron pot for use in making the cheeses
so famous throughout Tyrol.</p>

<p>The alcove serves as a store-room for the
cheeses, and for the dairy, while off to one end
is sometimes a room for such cattle as are ill or
young cattle who must be protected from the
chill night air of the mountain.</p>

<p>As evening advanced from all directions
came merry voices, ringing the clear notes of
yodels from over the mountainsides. Each
sennerin knows the peculiar yodel of her swain;
and you may be sure her heart beats light when
she hears, miles and miles away, the beautiful,
clear notes of his call. This is the only method
the mountaineers have of communicating with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
each other. The peculiar notes carry across
ravines and hillsides as distinctly as if one
were close at hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, father," said Ferdinand, as he touched
him upon the elbow, "what queer-looking men
these are! I have not seen such costumes about
here. Do they belong to Tyrol?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but these men are from the south,
from Meran. When a man is married he must
distinguish himself by placing a green cord
about his hat, so that he may not allow folks
to think him single; we other Austrians wear
the wedding-ring, the same as the women; but
in the different provinces, customs vary."</p>

<p>Ferdinand watched the different costumes of
the men, as they poured in from all directions.
There were some in brown jackets trimmed with
red, and wide brown suspenders; all Tyrolese
men wear these wide suspenders, sometimes
of one color, sometimes of another, but usually
green, of which color they are passionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
fond, no doubt because their country is so wonderfully
green. Most of the men wore knee
trousers of leather, while some were of homespun,
but that was an extravagance. The stockings,
usually grey and home-knitted, reached
from the ankle to just below the knee leaving
the latter bare. Without exception, all wore
the Tyrolese cap of rough green cloth, at the
back of which was the black-cock's tail, while
one or two isolated fellows were fortunate
enough to deck their hats with the Gamsbart or
Beard of the Chamois, as it is called; but this
is not the correct name for it, as it is not the
beard of the chamois but the long tuft which
grows upon his back in the winter.</p>

<p>On the green of the mountainside, in a spot
selected for its advantage of being as near level
as possible, the dance took place. The senner
and sennerin went through manœuvers that did
them credit; they swung each other in giddy
fashion until one almost believed they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
spin themselves down the mountainside, and
thus dance to their deaths; but after whirling
at great speed for many minutes, they would
suddenly pull up with a jerk and seem none the
worse for the whirling.</p>

<p>It was no unusual sight for Ferdinand to see
the Tyrolese dances; but here on the pasture
lands, on their native heath, he saw them perform
many which were most unfamiliar to him.
He always smiled when he saw the women place
their arms about their partners' necks and waltz
in that fashion; and then, when the couples
separated, the women to dance round and
round, holding out their full skirts to their
greatest width, while the men indulged in all
sorts of fantastic gymnastics, was truly bewildering.</p>

<p>At length the evening drew to a close; the
company dispersed as quickly as it had assembled,
and all was quiet upon the mountainside.
One might have imagined himself back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to the days of Old Rip Van Winkle, so mysterious
did the entire proceeding seem.</p>

<p>In the morning, the party descended the
mountain. The air was very clear, although
the day was cloudy, the sun steadfastly refusing
to appear; but this made walking agreeable
for which all were thankful.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear so many bells in your
life?" observed the city cousin.</p>

<p>"Oh, those are the cow-bells," replied Leopold.
"Each herd has its own peculiar tone,
so that the cattle won't get mixed up, where
there are so many together. And then the senner
can tell right away to which owner they belong."</p>

<p>"But there is such a constant tinkling, and
so many different tones, I don't see how one can
ever tell which is his own," replied the lad.</p>

<p>"That is because you are not used to it,"
answered his uncle. "After you have been on
the mountain awhile, you, too, would be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
distinguish your own bell as well as the senner
in charge."</p>

<p>And to the tinkling of the bells, the party
descended until they were well out of reach of
the bewitching sounds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THROUGH THE TYROLESE MOUNTAINS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the pedestrians reached home in the
early afternoon, a letter was awaiting Herr
Müller. It was from Herr Runkel, stating he
was obliged to make a visit to Dalmatia to see
his younger brother Max on business, and if
Herr Müller would care to make the trip with
him, he would meet him at Villach in Carinthia
the following Tuesday. Of course, there was
new excitement now for the boys; the one
wished to go with his father, while the other
was urgent in his demands that the cousin remain
with him. Finally it was arranged that
both boys should accompany Herr Müller,
while Frau Müller should remain with her relatives
and join her husband and son at Gratz in
Styria, on their return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<p>Leopold had never made a journey from
home before, except the one time he had been
to Innsbruck, quite recently, to meet his Müller
relations; so you may be certain there was one
little heart which beat faster than normal.</p>

<p>"We shall leave to-morrow, then," decided
Herr Müller, "if you think you can be ready
in that time," he added, addressing the Tyrolese
youngster. "Because we shall want to visit
some of the mountain towns; and if you boys
want to see anything of Tyrol we had better
walk than take the train."</p>

<p>"Oh, I could be ready to-night," ventured
the child, delighted beyond measure. But his
uncle assured him the morning would be ample
time, and the two lads skipped away to talk
over the plans.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">

<div class="caption">"TRAMP THUS, IN VAGABOND FASHION, OVER THE MOUNTAINS!"</div>
</div>

<p>As the sun was just beginning to peep above
the mountaintop, the party of three set off,
with many admonitions from Frau Hofer to her
child, and many also from Frau Müller that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Ferdinand should not allow his cousin to be too
adventuresome. But to this Leopold smiled.</p>

<p>"I am used to the mountains, auntie," he
said. "Ferdinand will tire long before I do,
you'll see."</p>

<p>How glorious it was to tramp thus, in vagabond
fashion, over the mountains! They
stopped wherever night overtook them, passed
through Brixen, the wine center of much importance
in Tyrol, and on through narrow defiles
through which there seemed no exit. A
bracing walk of six miles from Brixen brought
them to Klausen, or The Pass, so completely
hidden among mountains there was but room
for one long, narrow street.</p>

<p>"Well, I had no idea Klausen was quite so
narrow," Herr Müller remarked. "I can well
believe the tale of the barber, now."</p>

<p>"What barber, uncle?" asked Leopold.</p>

<p>"The barber of Klausen. You've never
heard it? Well, there once lived a barber in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
this town who was old and full of rheumatism;
he had a client whom he must shave every
morning; but the poor barber found it very
difficult to descend three flights of steps from
his dwelling and ascend three more on the opposite
side of the street, in order to shave his
customer. He could not afford to lose this fee,
yet it was exceedingly painful for him to attempt
the climb.</p>

<p>"One morning he opened his window and
called to his neighbor. Upon hearing the barber's
voice, the man in the opposite house
opened his window and asked what was wanted.</p>

<p>"'Allow me,' said the ingenious barber.
'I am unable to descend the stairs this morning;
my rheumatism is getting the better of me.
But, in order that you may not lose your shave,
if you will lean a little way out of your window,
I shall be able to accomplish the duty quite as
well as though you were sitting in your chair in
your room.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"For a moment the man hesitated; but, as
the village was small, and there was but one
barber, it was either a question of going unshaved,
or of following the fellow's advice.
Accordingly, he consented; he stretched his
neck far out of the window, the barber placed
the towel beneath his chin, and, with all the
dexterity in his power, he proceeded to shave
his client; and thenceforth the barber performed
this operation in a similar manner, quite
to the satisfaction of them both."</p>

<p>They passed on through the village of Waidbruck,
the very center of romanticism; for here,
right at the mouth of the Grodener-thal, rises
the fascinating Castle of Trostburg, the home
of the Counts of Wolkenstein; and here was
born Count Oswald, the last of all the long line
of Minnesingers or troubadours, who found employment
and enjoyment in wandering from
castle to castle, their harps or zithers under
their arms, singing love-songs or reciting war-stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that stirred the young blood to action.</p>

<p>They climbed to the magnificent Castle of
Hauerstein, so hidden among the mountain-peaks
and dense woods that one might imagine
it to be the palace of the Sleeping Beauty; and
then they diverged a few miles up the ravine in
order to visit Santa Claus' shops, for such might
be called the village of St. Ulrich with its countless
numbers of toy shops. In every cottage
men, women and young children busy themselves
from morning until night, from one year's
end to the other, in making toys; carved animals
for Noah's Arks, dolls and wagons, to
supply the world's demand of the children.
Here, too, the very language is different from
any other spoken roundabout; for the inhabitants,
primitive in language as in everything else,
still cling to the tongue of the Romans, which
is to-day known as the Ladin or Romansch
tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>They passed the night at Botzen, and, as the
sun sunk behind the lofty mountains just beyond,
a gorgeous glow overspread their entire summit.</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful!" remarked the two lads
almost at the same moment.</p>

<p>"And it looks just like a rose-garden, too,"
added Leopold.</p>

<p>"It is a rose-garden, child," answered Herr
Müller. "It is called the Rosengarten or
Gardl (Little Garden)."</p>

<p>"But is it possible, father," asked Ferdinand,
"that roses will bloom on such lofty
heights?"</p>

<p>"Well, this is the legend about it. Once
upon a time, there lived an ugly dwarf who was
king over all the underground sprites and elves
in the mountains of Tyrol. He was in the habit
of going forth from his palace, wrapped in a
magic cloak which rendered him invisible.
Now, it chanced that during one of these expeditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Laurin went into the country of Styria,
which lies right over there to the east. We
shall pass that way on our return to Vienna.
He saw a most beautiful maiden who was playing
in a meadow with her attendants. Suddenly
she disappeared from before the very eyes of
her companions; they shouted, but no answer
came back to them; in great dismay they fled
back to the castle to report the news to the
princess' brother Dietlieb.</p>

<p>"Dietlieb had heard of Laurin and his propensity
for carrying off fair maidens; Dietlieb
was a brave knight and had traveled far, so, as
soon as he heard the news, he suspicioned at
once that Laurin had done the deed. Immediately
he set out for the city of Bern, where
the king held his court, to demand that the
dwarf be punished for his insolence. But the
king was powerless against Laurin's magic;
however, he warned Dietlieb not to attempt to
approach too near the dwarf's domains, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was guarded by four magnificent pillars of
shining gold, and a fence of silken thread
stretched between.</p>

<p>"'Remember,' said the king, 'should you
happen to break so much as one strand of
Laurin's fence, he will demand the forfeit of a
foot and a hand.'</p>

<p>"In hot rage Dietlieb left the king's palace;
what mattered to him Laurin's magic powers,
if only he could recover his dear sister, the
Princess Kunhild?</p>

<p>"With a few faithful companions he set out
over the mountains until he reached the Rose-garden
before the dwarf's underground abode,
the very sight of which so enraged the worthy
knight that he tore away the silken threads and
destroyed the four gorgeous pillars.</p>

<p>"Within his subterranean palace, Laurin
heard the destruction without; he mounted his
war-horse, and putting on his magic belt, which
endowed him with supernatural strength, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
appeared at the door of the cave covered with
sparkling jewels from head to foot.</p>

<p>"'Who has dared to enter my domains?' he
shouted. 'And to destroy my garden? Let
him who has done the deed stand forth that I
may exact the punishment!'</p>

<p>"'Be not so hasty, Sir Laurin,' replied one
of the knights, 'we will gladly repay you three,
four-fold, if you wish, what you demand. The
season is early and your roses will bloom again.'</p>

<p>"'I care not for your gold,' replied the indignant
king; 'I have gold and to spare. I
demand satisfaction, and satisfaction I shall
have.'</p>

<p>"So saying, he spurred on his horse. There
was a hotly contested battle; in the end, he was
overpowered by Dietlieb, who had torn from
him his magic belt, and thus robbed him of his
strength.</p>

<p>"'Come,' said Laurin, 'let us not harbor ill
feelings against one another. Come into my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
palace, Sir Knights, and drink to the health of
the fair Kunhild.'</p>

<p>"He led them through the door of the cave,
down several long corridors at the end of each
of which was a stout door, one of bronze, another
of steel and a third of gold, and entered
the banquet hall, where the table was gorgeously
decorated with gold and silver and most rare
flowers.</p>

<p>"As the dinner drew to a close&mdash;at which
Kunhild had presided, dazzling with jewels&mdash;the
knights fell into a sound doze; when they
awoke each was locked securely in a separate
cell with no means of communicating one with
the other. But, when all was still, Kunhild entered
her brother's dungeon and released him
by the aid of her magic arts, which she had
learned while captive.</p>

<p>"'Take this ring,' she said, 'gather up your
weapons and flee for your life.'</p>

<p>"'But will you go with me?' he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>


<p>"'I will come later,' she replied. 'But make
your escape now before Laurin discovers us.'</p>

<p>"Dietlieb did not require a second bidding.
The magic of Laurin had penetrated through
the stone walls of the cell, however, and he followed
the knight to the outer earth and there
they fought a terrible battle. When Laurin
found himself yielding to the superior strength
of the knight, he blew a shrill blast upon his
golden horn, and five enormous giants appeared.
Meanwhile Kunhild had not been idle;
she had released the companions of her brother,
who now rushed to the scene of the fray, and
in spite of his magic arts, and his reinforcement
of the five giants, Laurin was made prisoner
and carried off into Styria. The garden was left
uncared for, and little by little it died; but on
just such evenings as this, one can see the gorgeous
roses, which will bloom only as the sun
descends."</p>

<p>"Do you think, father," said Ferdinand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
"that there is really an underground palace in
those mountains?"</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i145.jpg" width="550" height="362" alt="photo of valley" />
<div class="caption">THE ROSENGARTEN.</div>
</div>

<p>"Well, that's what they say; many have
tried to find the entrance, but the key has been
lost; some day, one may be fortunate enough to
find it, and then great riches will be his. It is
my private opinion that within those mountains
lie metals unknown to exist, and when one has
opened the door to them, he will discover great
riches in them."</p>

<p>"I should like to gather just <i>one</i> rose, uncle,"
said Leopold. "I think mother would like to
have one, for she has never seen the Rosengarten."</p>

<p>"You cannot do that, my boy, because they
are not real roses; the rocks of the mountain
are composed of magnesia and chalk, which
take on these beautiful colors when the rays of
the setting sun fall upon them; and it is only
the sharp, jagged points of those rocks which
simulate roses, that you see."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Another night would see them out of Tyrol,
much to the regret of Ferdinand, for he had
never imagined such an interesting land to exist.</p>

<p>"How did Tyrol come to belong to our country,
father?" asked Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"Well, in the olden times," answered Herr
Müller, "Tyrol was governed by counts who
ruled like kings; but in 1363 a princess was the
ruler; she was a woman with a very hasty
temper and was nicknamed Pocket-mouthed
Meg. Some say she received this nickname because
her mouth was so extraordinarily large;
but others tell a tale of her Bavarian cousin,
who lived in the adjoining territory, who struck
her on the mouth during a quarrel. It certainly
was not a very gentlemanly thing for the Bavarian
cousin to do, but children were not brought
up so carefully as they are to-day, and you must
not think too harshly of this little Bavarian,
which sounds quite like barbarian. But Queen
Margaret could never forgive nor forget that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
blow; in after years, when her own son was
dead, and her kingdom must be left to some
one, she preferred to give it to her Habsburg
cousins, who were Austrians, so that ever since,
with the exception of a few years in which several
nations struggled for possession of it, it
has belonged to the Austrian Empire.</p>

<p>"You know Emperor Maximilian I, who was
one of our greatest rulers, loved Tyrol best of
all his provinces," continued Herr Müller.</p>

<p>"I don't blame him," replied Ferdinand, "I
think he was quite right."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE HABICHT-BURG RAVENS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Botzen, the train took them through
the Puster-thal, which is on the north boundary
of Italy, and on to Villach in Carinthia, where
they were to meet Herr Runkel. There were
great demonstrations when he saw the two
young lads.</p>

<p>"Have you never been to Dalmatia?" he
asked them.</p>

<p>Both shook their heads negatively.</p>

<p>"What a splendid thing, then, that business
called me to Zara," he replied, "for Dalmatia
is one of the provinces of our empire which is
different from any of the others. You see, in
the first place, it is on the Adriatic Sea, and
could one have vision that would carry that far,
he might glance over into the opposite country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of Italy. But, as if to make up for that lack
of supernatural power, Italy has brought her
customs and manners into Dalmatia, so we shall
really be seeing two countries at one time."</p>

<p>Through Carinthia the party made its way,
over the Kara-Wanken Mountains into Istria
and spent the night at Trieste. As neither of
the boys had seen the sea before, it was a never-ending
source of wonder and delight to them
to wander about the wharves, to see the ships
of many nations lying in the harbor, flying their
flags of many colors, and to see the curious
sights of a sea-town. There was nothing to
remind them of Austria with its German customs,
even the name of the city (Tergeste)
being Roman, which was conquered by that nation,
and colonized about <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 41. There are
no longer strassen (streets), but vias, and
piazzas (squares) take the place of platze.
As in most Italian cities, there were narrow,
winding streets, some of which were nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
more than mere flights of steps lined on each
side, in place of a balustrade, with houses.</p>

<p>In the morning it had been arranged to make
a hasty trip to Miramar, the charming residence
of the Archduke Maximilian, the favorite
brother of the emperor.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Herr Müller, "that the
ominous ravens warned the archduke of the
fatality which should overtake him in accepting
the throne of Mexico at the instance of
Napoleon III of France. And the raven's
warning came true, for the unfortunate young
prince never returned."</p>

<p>"Tell us about the ravens, father," said Ferdinand,
as they stood upon the terrace before
the villa, overlooking the wonderful Adriatic.</p>

<p>"Well, you know the house of Habsburg occupies
the Austrian throne to-day," began Herr
Müller.</p>

<p>"<i>Yawohl</i>," replied the two simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Well, many hundreds of years ago, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
founder of the Habsburg dynasty, Count
Rudolph, was born in a very ancient and formidable
castle in the northern part of Switzerland,
somewhere near Zurich. The castle was known
throughout the country by the peculiar name of
the Hawk's Castle or Habicht-burg, from a
story concerning one of the first counts who
lived there.</p>

<p>"This was Count Gontran, of Altenbourg.
He was a brave and gallant knight and loved
to spend his time among the mountains hunting,
when he was not away to the war. As he was
so fearless in this sport, pursuing his enemy to
the remotest spots of their lairs, he gained the
sobriquet of the 'Hawk Count' or Der Habicht
Graf.</p>

<p>"One day he had climbed to the top of a
most peculiarly shaped rock, which much resembled
a fortress. In his eagerness to reach
the summit he had lost sight of his companions;
but in his joy at the marvelous panorama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
spread beneath him, he quite forgot all about
them, and gave himself up only to the spell of
the wildness surrounding him.</p>

<p>"Suddenly the air grew thick with moving
objects; the sun was hidden from sight, and
then the count realized that numberless vultures,
whose habitation he had invaded, had
gathered about the rock in swarms, waiting for
their time to come when they might claim him
their victim. But Der Habicht Graf was no
craven; he made no attempt to fight; well he
knew they would not attack him until he had
passed that stage when he would be able to
defend himself.</p>

<p>"All at once, while he thus stood defying his
antagonists, a shrill cawing was heard on all
sides; in a few moments the air was filled with
innumerable ravens who seemed to have appeared
from out the very heavens, so silently
and unexpectedly had they come. There was a
sharp battle between the two swarms, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
smaller birds being able to drive off the larger
on account of their greater numbers. And then,
when all vestige of both feathered tribes had
disappeared, Count Gontran was able to find
his way down the almost inaccessible rock,
where he joined his companions at its base, who
had given him up for lost, as their shouts had
failed to reach him, and no answering call came
back to them.</p>

<p>"From that day Der Habicht Graf chose the
raven for his pennon; he became their protector,
feeding them in winter, until, as time went on,
they became verily a pest.</p>

<p>"Der Habicht Graf died, and others came
into possession of Der Habicht-burg. There
was little sentiment in these descendants concerning
the ravens, and when Count Rudolph
succeeded to the estate in 1240, he had them all
driven away or killed. Ever since that time,
the birds have taken a peculiar delight in foretelling
disaster to the house of Habsburg (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Habicht-burg has been corrupted into). And
right here, in this garden," continued Herr
Müller, "was where the ravens came and flew
about the heads of the Archduke Maximilian
and his young wife Carlota before they left on
that fatal journey."</p>

<p>"What happened then, father?"</p>

<p>"Surely you must know. The Mexicans refused
to accept a foreign ruler; he was sentenced
to be shot, and although Carlota made
the trip to France three times to beg Napoleon
III to save her husband, the emperor was deaf
to all her appeals."</p>

<p>"That was because Napoleon was not born
a king, father," remarked Ferdinand. "Had
he been <i>truly</i> royal, he would have saved
Maximilian."</p>

<p>Herr Müller made no further comment, but
shook his head slowly in an affirmative nod.</p>

<p>From Trieste the boat was taken to Pola, one
of the oldest cities in the country, quite at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
extreme tip of Istria. Although the Romans
built a city here in 178 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, yet many of the
ancient landmarks remain, among which, outside
the ancient city walls, stands the splendid
Amphitheatre where gladiators fought and wild
beasts contended with human beings for supremacy.</p>

<p>As Herr Runkel was obliged to make Zara
on a specified day, they were not permitted to
linger in the Istrian peninsula, with its almost
continuous olive-groves and vineyards, famous
throughout the world; but boarding a small
steamer they slowly made their way to the sea-coast
town of Zara in Dalmatia, stretching like
a lizard along the Adriatic.</p>

<p>No longer was there sign of modernism or
progress; every object, every peasant spoke of
the past, of long-flown glory, and of poverty.
One could almost imagine himself back in those
days, six hundred or more years before Christ,
when the Argonauts inhabited the spot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
who, in turn, ceded to the Celts and they to the
inevitable Romans. Then Charlemagne coveted
Dalmatia; later the influential Venetians
wrested it from the Germans; and in 1798 it
was finally ceded to Austria, to whom it has
ever since belonged, except for a short period
when it belonged to France.</p>

<p>The peasants were gorgeous in their gay costumes;
there were men in light-colored trousers,
very tight fitting, laced with fancy cords of gold
or silver thread, and most elaborately embroidered
about the pockets in front; there were
short jackets of bright cloth designed in intricate
fashion in tinseled thread, with tassels about the
edges; there were women with blue skirts, very
short, over which was an apron so heavily embroidered
that it seemed more like an Oriental
rug than a bit of cloth, while the bodice was
one mass of embroidery. Every conceivable
spot was embroidered; about the neck, the
shoulders, down the front and at the wrists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
There was color, color, color; fringes and tassels
and gold thread, as if these poor gewgaws
could make up to the peasant for all the poverty
he suffered and the monotony of his life. But
how charming they did look in their apparel;
if their lives were not the sunniest, they surely
tried to embody the very sunlight into their
clothing, and that helps a lot, for they were
never so happy as when decked in their gayest,
wearing the hand-made filigree silver ornaments
about their necks, in their ears and upon
their fingers, even about their waists, which no
persuasion nor hunger can prevail upon them to
part with.</p>

<p>Herr Runkel's younger brother Max was an
apprentice in Zara; his term was about to expire
and some arrangement must be made for
the future. It was this which had brought Herr
Runkel to Zara. While he was busy with his
brother's affairs, the rest of the party wandered
about the ancient city; they visited the market-place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
alive and riotous with brilliant coloring;
they inspected the wharves, and commented
upon St. Mark's Lion, which reposed over the
entrance-gate from the harbor, in the city wall,
a relic of Venetian invasion, as if that stone lion
was yet watching for the return of his people.
They even crossed over to the islands, which lie
like so many bits of broken mainland, to watch
the fishing which is so remunerative, the sardine
fishery being one of the greatest sources of
revenue of the country.</p>

<p>His business terminated satisfactorily, Herr
Runkel suggested they might return by way of
the provinces of Bosnia, Croatia and Styria, because
these held such wonders in sightseeing
for the children.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THROUGH DALMATIA AND THE BORDER-LANDS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> the following morning they made
their start, packs on backs, over the low, waste
lands of Dalmatia. The sun was burning hot;
nothing but extensive plains of desert met the
eye; far in the distance were low mountains,
which glistened in the scorching sun with a
startling whiteness, most dazzling to the eyes.
There was a sameness about the landscape
which wearied the boys.</p>

<p>"I certainly should not like to live here," remarked
Leopold; "it is not so nice as Tyrol;
there is too much barrenness, and too much
dazzling whiteness."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," replied his uncle, "this is a
fine country; the wine and olive oil are famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the world over, to say nothing of the fruit and
flowers. If you did but stop to think about it,
most of the fruit and flowers we have in Vienna
out of season come from this region."</p>

<p>"But how can anything grow in a desert?"</p>

<p>"We shall soon see," replied his uncle.
"Dalmatia looks baked, but it is extremely productive."</p>

<p>After some time, the soil began to grow more
and more irregular. Great stones lay upon the
surface, and immense fissures opened up at irregular
distances.</p>

<p>"Now, my boy, can you call this a desert?"
asked Herr Müller. "Here are the gardens
of Dalmatia."</p>

<p>"The gardens?" exclaimed both children.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But I see nothing but great ravines," said
Leopold.</p>

<p>"They are not ravines, child, but great cracks
opened up in the swampy soil which has burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
asunder from the terrific heat of the sun. But
that is what saves the country from starvation;
on the bottom of these fissures are deposits of
fertile soil washed into them by the rains, and
here the peasant plants his crops. Here you
see one too narrow to plant anything in, but
over there," and he pointed to the immediate
right, "is one which stretches a mile or more."</p>

<p>"How interesting!" exclaimed Ferdinand.
"But what a queer place to plant crops."</p>

<p>At the farm-house, a low, uninviting hut with
thatch roof, they stopped to fill their flasks.
The farmer led them to the rear of the house
where was a huge tank of stagnant water.</p>

<p>"But we cannot drink that," said Herr
Runkel, astonished.</p>

<p>"It is all there is," remarked the peasant.
"In Dalmatia we drink rain water. It is all we
have. There are no streams in Dalmatia except
in the mountains, and often those are underground."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Underground?" cried Ferdinand. "How
do you get the water then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the water runs along in the limestone
until it meets with some obstruction, or when it
deems it time to appear upon the surface, then
it will flow on in a fine stream for some distance,
when perhaps it will disappear again for
awhile."</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing," said Leopold,
to whom water was so very plentiful in
Tyrol.</p>

<p>"It is a wise precaution of Nature," answered
the peasant. "In these hot lands, were
it not for this provision, the streams would soon
dry up."</p>

<p>"But why don't you convey this water from
the mountains to your home?" asked Herr
Müller.</p>

<p>"That costs too much; we have no money
to spend on luxuries; we have the rain and we
gather the water as it falls."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Walking on, having thanked the peasant
for his courtesy, they came in sight of a
convent.</p>

<p>"Now we shall have some fresh water, I
am bound," said Herr Müller. "Convents are
always well supplied with refreshments of all
kinds."</p>

<p>A friar in brown costume opened the door
to them and ushered them into a cool courtyard,
paved with brick, in which were small openings
at regular intervals. At the well in the centre
of the court the flasks were filled with delicious,
clear, cool water.</p>

<p>"It surprises me," said Herr Runkel, "that
you have such delicious water here, while just
below, a mile or two, the peasant told us there
was no water available for miles around, except
rain water."</p>

<p>"He is quite right, too," returned the affable
friar. "If it were not for the rain we should
all perish; but the peasant does not take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
pains to collect the rain in just the same manner
as we do."</p>

<p>He then explained to them the method of
obtaining the drinking water. The earth under
the brick pavement was dug out to the depth
of several feet; the sides and bottom were lined
with some hard substance, sometimes clay, sometimes
cement, to form a foundation to the cistern.
In the middle of the pit was built a well
of brick; fine, clean sand was then put in to the
level of the court; the brick pavement was then
laid, through the openings of which the rain
passed into the bed of sand, and, as it seeped
through the brick well eventually the sand filtered
the water from all impurities and imparted
to it a taste, without which it would have been
"flat."</p>

<p>A brief rest, and some slight refreshment,
upon which the friar insisted, and the travelers
plodded on; they passed peasants pushing
crude wooden ploughs such as have been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
use since long-forgotten ages, but which seem
specially adapted to the rocky, stubborn soil
of Dalmatia. And being so close to the border
of Bosnia they encountered Bosnian peasants,
fine tall men much like Turks in their costumes,
for Turkey lies just next door on the south.
The Bosnian Mohammedan women veil their
faces like the Turkish women, and wear white
garments with an apron of many colors, not
outdoing, however, the men with their gold embroidered
vests, their scarlet jackets and the fez
upon their heads. A curious contrariety of
nature is, that although the Bosnians and Herzegovians
dislike the Turk, nevertheless they
cling to the Turkish costume with pertinacity.
So deep was their hatred of the Turk that these
two provinces combined and placed themselves
under the Austrian rule.</p>

<p>As night approached, the travelers made
their way towards a very large, low house surrounded
with outbuildings, and all enclosed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a strong palisade of timbers built for defense.</p>

<p>"We shall pass the night at the Community
House," said Herr Runkel.</p>

<p>"A Community House?" repeated Leopold.</p>

<p>"Yes. You see, in the olden times, the
borders of this country, and the neighboring
ones, Servia, Bosnia, Croatia and Roumania,
were constantly being overrun by the Turks,
who have always been the dread of nations,
their cruelty being proverbial. The inhabitants
of these border-countries were forced to protect
themselves, as in unity was their strength.
Consequently, they built a Community or General
House in which the villagers might live together
for mutual protection, and mutual benefit
as well."</p>

<p>"But they don't have wars to fear any more,
do they?" asked Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"No. Nevertheless custom of long-standing
cannot be lightly laid aside. Our empress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Maria-Theresa, seeing the advantage these
communities afforded as a means of defense,
had a long line of them built, seven thousand
miles long, from the Carpathian Mountains on
the east of Transylvania to the sea-coast in
Croatia to protect the border from the Turks,
but now these fortifications have been abandoned.
However, isolated Communities remain,
being a part of the customs of Servia,
and you will find them vastly different from
anything you have yet seen."</p>

<p>It was quite late in the afternoon; the sun
had not yet sunk, because the days were at their
longest; however, it was certainly dinner-time,
if not past, and the party were hungry.</p>

<p>Knocking at the door of the largest and most
important-looking building, which was of
timber, and one story only, it was opened by
a young man in Servian costume who ushered
them into the room. It was an enormous room,
to say the least; in the centre extended a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
wooden table set for the evening meal, and
about which were already seated the inhabitants
of the Community.</p>

<p>The eldest man, who had the honor to be, at
the time, the Stareshina or Hausvater, arose
from his seat and greeted the strangers.</p>

<p>"And may we have the honor of receiving
you as our guests?" he asked, simply.</p>

<p>Herr Runkel thanked him, and explained
that they were on a tour of the provinces with
the lads, and should be most grateful for a
night's shelter. Room was made for them at
the table, and right heartily were they received
by the Zadruga, or Community family. The
two boys were lost in admiration of all they
saw; and although they were plied with cheeses
and meats and bread, and even fruits of all
kinds, yet their hunger seemed to have left
them in their wonderment. At one end of the
great room was a brick stove or sort of fireplace,
the largest either of the lads had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
seen. To carry off the smoke from the blazing
logs, was built a huge canopy, round and very
large at the bottom, tapering to a small circumference
at the top, and allowing the smoke
to escape through the open roof at that point.
Over the fire, but high enough to prevent them
being burned, were cross-beams from which
hung huge pieces of beef, bacons, hams and all
sorts of meat smoking for future use, while the
cooking was done in huge pots of iron suspended
by chains from the beams.</p>

<p>The women were dressed in white linen bodices
with long, flowing sleeves; their skirts were
a combination of two wide aprons, one at the
front and one at the back, over which was another
smaller apron elaborately embroidered
in brilliant colors. About their waists were
scarlet sashes, with a second somewhat higher
up of the same brilliant hue; red leather high
boots, filigree silver ornaments or beads about
their necks, and on their heads a filmy veil with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fancy border fastened to the hair with a silver
pin, and hanging far down over their shoulders
like a mist. In this most picturesque costume
they certainly resembled our scarlet flamingo or
bird-of-paradise more than anything else one
could think of.</p>

<p>The men, too, were splendid in their gay
costumes; loose trousers like the Turks, with
top-boots of black leather; scarlet vests embellished
with silver thread and silver buttons,
and white coats, very long, reaching almost to
the boots.</p>

<p>The meal finished, the Stareshina (the presiding
elder of the Zadruga) and his wife, the
Domatchina (which means homekeeper), arose
and thus gave the signal for the others to arise.
Those women whose allotted work it was to
attend to the clearing of the table, betook themselves
to the task. The Domatchina arranges
all the work to be done by each during the
week, and turn about is taken, so that there may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
be no cause for dissatisfaction, while the Stareshina
attends to the matters of the farm. Thus
harmony always prevails; prosperity reigns
wherever these Communities are established,
and happiness is paramount.</p>

<p>Although there seemed no apparent necessity
for a fire, fresh logs were added. The men
brought out their pipes, drew up the benches
toward the hearth and began conversation.
Some brought their musical instruments; the
women sat with their spinning or sewing, while
the little girls even, were occupied with elaborate
embroideries for their trousseaux later in
life, which are always begun in childhood.</p>

<p>There was great unity and happiness in the
circle. Amid laughter, song and anecdotes the
evening passed; as the hour advanced the
Stareshina conducted evening prayers. Goodnight
was said by all, and each family betook
himself to his own vayat (hut) outside the main
building or Koutcha, which alone was reserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
for the use of the Stareshina and the unmarried
members of his family. As soon as one of his
family should marry, he would have a separate
vayat built for him about the Koutcha.</p>

<p>The travelers were conducted to the guest-house,
reserved solely for that purpose, and
long into the night the children lay and talked
over the strange customs they had seen, and
plied their elders with endless questions as to
the meaning of it all.</p>

<p>"Let them be children, Fred," said Herr
Runkel. "We brought them on this trip to
learn," and he explained to them those things
they wished so much to know. That the Slavs
never allow their hearth-fire to die out, no matter
how hot the season, for as surely as they do,
all sorts of evils would befall them; that is one
of the unswerving superstitions of the nation.
The fire of their hearth is as a sacred flame to
them, which must be tended and cared for with
unremitting zeal, which harks back to the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of paganism when the fire was looked upon
as the most sacred thing in their religion, and
was kept ever burning in their temples and public
places; finally it became the custom for each
family to have his own hearth or fire, but the
superstition that should it die out it would bring
all sorts of maledictions upon the household,
has remained. No doubt the difficulty of obtaining
the fire by means of friction (matches
of course, being unknown) accounted for the
careful preservation of the flame. However it
be, the Slavs still retain the ancient custom.</p>

<p>He explained to them how the House father
and the House mother of this great family are
elected by vote, serving a given number of
years; sometimes one, sometimes more, as custom
establishes; but usually the eldest man in
the Community holds that post of honor, while
his wife is the House mother. He told the
lads how the farm is worked by each member
of the Zadruga under the supervision and instruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the Stareshina, each receiving his
share, according to his labor, at the end of the
season, the finances being in charge of the House
father. He told them how many of the young
men, longing for higher education at the universities
or in the arts, such as painting, etc.,
were sent by the Zadruga to the city which
afforded the best advantages for them, the expenses
being borne by the Community funds,
should there not be sufficient to the young men's
credit to pay for it, entirely; this extra sum
being repaid when the students should be in
position to do so.</p>

<p>The children were fascinated with the Community,
where every one seemed so happy and
well cared for; and they begged to be allowed
to remain many days, but Herr Müller reminded
them that Frau Müller would be awaiting
them at Gratz.</p>

<p>"But we shall come again, <i>nicht wahr, mein
Vater?</i>" asked Ferdinand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, we shall come again, and soon
maybe," he replied.</p>

<p>"And I, too?" queried Leopold.</p>

<p>"<i>Naturlich.</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Off in the morning, the party journeyed
through the southeastern portion of Carniola,
so rich in mountains and minerals. There were
unusual sights to be seen here, too; huge caverns
were fashioned in the rocks, and grottoes
of curious formations. They saw the peasant
women making lace, a product for which the
province is particularly famed.</p>

<p>At Marburg, Herr Runkel and Leopold
Hofer bade farewell to their companions, and
boarded the train for Innsbruck where Herr
Hofer would meet his young son; while Herr
Müller and Ferdinand continued on up into
Styria to the city of Gratz, where Frau Müller
awaited them.</p>

<p>Styria, or Steiermark, is a splendid province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of the Austria-Hungarian empire, famous even
in the time of the Romans, for its production
of ore, and holding to-day an important place
in the commercial world for its minerals.
Gratz, the capital, is a charming city with an
excellent university, and lies on the River Mur.
It has been said of it that it is "La Ville des
Grâces sur la rivière de l'Amour" (the favored
city on the river of Love) being a play upon
words, amour (love) being interpreted Mur.</p>

<p>Of course there was an excursion to the
Castle-hill, where formerly stood the ancient
castle; and Herr Müller pointed out to the
children the spot where Charles II ordered
twenty thousand books of the Protestant faith
to be burned in public.</p>

<p>A few days' visit and they were once more on
their way for Vienna, and home. Ferdinand's
tongue had never ceased to chatter, there were
so many interesting details to report to the
mother; and when Vienna was reached it did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
seem as if the child never could settle down to
life in the City, after his splendid rambles about
the open country, wandering where he willed.</p>

<p>"Father," he remarked, after some days at
home, "we did not go to Moravia. We visited
all the provinces except that."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true," replied his father, "but,
you know, we lingered longer than we intended,
and Teresa is due to arrive shortly. We shall
have to reserve Moravia for another vacation-time.
I think you will not find the customs
there very different, however, from those of
Bohemia.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But I should like to have you see

our emperor Franz-Joseph was proclaimed
king."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>VIENNA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the arrival of Teresa Runkel busy
days followed; visits to the Prater, which Emperor
Joseph II had dedicated to the public for
a playground and recreation park; to the
Capuchin Church, where lie the remains of the
imperial families from the time of Matthias I
in 1619, and where the ill-starred Duke of
Reichstadt (L'Aiglon), the only son of Napoleon
of France, lies buried among his kinsfolks,
as well as his imperial mother, Marie
Louise. And, best of all, there was the excursion
to the Castle of Laxenburg just outside
Vienna, one of the imperial chateaux, standing
in the midst of a miniature island, which is
reached by a tiny ferry boat, quite as though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
were some ancient feudal castle with its moat,
minus the drawbridge and portcullis.</p>

<p>Here they were frightened nearly out of their
senses while inspecting the dungeons, at hearing
an automaton chained to the wall shake
its cumbersome fetters as if he were some
prisoner living out his days in the hopelessness
of the dungeon. But Herr Müller quieted the
alarms of the young girl by explaining the pleasantry
of the custodian, who gives his visitors
thrills, which is what they really come for, as
he says.</p>

<p>"I wish you could be here for the ice-carnival,
Teresa," said Ferdinand, after one busy day's
sight-seeing. "It's wonderful, with the lake
all lit up by electric lights and lanterns, and
tiny booths dotted here and there, and skaters
in their furs and gay gowns. Can't you manage
to come at Christmas time?"</p>

<p>"I should love to," she replied. "I'll write
and ask brother Franz if I may."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"And maybe mother will let us go to one
of the masked balls," the lad said, half hesitatingly,
for he knew this would, indeed, be a
privilege.</p>

<p>"Scarcely yet, Ferdinand; children do not
attend balls; but there are countless other festivities
for children, which would delight
Teresa much more than a masked ball at which
she could but look on. It is far better to be a
participant, isn't it, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, much," answered the child, politely.
Nevertheless, she did wish she might see the
ball.</p>

<p>A few days later Ferdinand and his mother
drove the Austrian girl to the railroad station,
where she was met by the Sister who
would conduct her and others to the Convent.</p>

<p>At the conductor's call "Einsteigen!" the
doors of the train were fastened, and Ferdinand
waved farewell to his little friend, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
whose childish head flashed visions of a merry
Yule-tide to come, passed in the home of her
friends, with dances and parties, and skating
and endless merriment.</p>
